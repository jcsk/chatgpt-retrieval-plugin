In the late 1800s, developer, entrepreneur, and Calistoga founder Samuel Brannan saw the tourism potential for these hot springs, ultimately opening the Calistoga Hot Springs Hotel on the land he purchased in the area. In time, Calistoga became known for these natural hot springs, and a wellness destination was born, with unique therapeutic treatments to go with it, such as the famous mud bath\u2014a now-iconic spa treatment that, according to one spa-goer, \u201cfeels like you're simultaneously floating in mid-air while an elephant is sitting on you.\u201d Think cozy-weighted-blanket-meets-breezy-hot-air-balloon-ride.

        "title": "Napa River \u2014 Adventures On and Off the Water",
        "text": "The Napa River is one of the largest Central Coast Range rivers, running 50 miles from Mt. St. Helena to the San Pablo Bay. It's an important part of the local ecosystem, providing a home to many species of fish, birds, and wildlife. The Napa River also winds through downtown Napa , offering a serene, gurgling backdrop to a plethora of Wine Country experiences, all right along the water. We've compiled some of our favorite places to eat, drink, and stay by the Napa riverfront, in addition to some unique things to do for the more adventure-inclined. Where to Adventure Courtesy of Napa Valley Wine Yacht For those looking for a unique Napa experience without forgoing some of the best wine Napa Valley has to offer, look no further than these Napa River WineCountry Experiences . Tour the river on a 50-foot catamaran with Winemaker Cruise on the Wine Yacht , all while enjoying a beautiful four-course meal by Chef Kadiye, of Tarla Grill , and wine from AUM Cellars. Looking for a workout to pair with your wine course? Join a private river tour with Napa Valley Paddle . Experience the most impressive stretch of the Napa River, from salt water wetlands to fresh water forest. Paddle the restored tidal area and see downtown Napa like never before. For those looking to not get their sea legs, a casual stroll can happen right downtown and includes river views and ample shopping from stores like the Napa General Store , Riverhouse by Bespoke Collection, and more. And for those looking to really connect with nature both in and out of town, there's a 4.2 mile, casual hike on the Napa River Trail. If you're visiting in the summer, enjoy a balmy evening at the Veterans Memorial Park Amphitheater for Napa City Nights , the concert series that happens Friday evenings. With terraced riverfront seating, live music, and beautiful views of the Napa River, it's a great way to wind down after a day of Wine Country activities. Where to Taste Courtesy of JaM Cellars There are also plenty of options for wine tasting for all the landlubbers who want to enjoy a river view without getting wet. In downtown Napa, check out Acumen Winery Gallery, featuring estate wines from organically-grown grapes on Atlas Peak, New Frontier Wine Co. , showcasing luxury Napa wines from renowned global winemakers, and JaM Cellars , which offers easy to love wines for you to enjoy in their music studio tasting room (complete with a classic vinyl collection and weekly live-music JaMSessions). Outland Wines tasting room feels like a local neighborhood spot and features a tightly curated selection of wines from three local producers. Where to Eat Courtesy of Celadon If you're strolling along the riverfront, you might venture down the dreamy, floral corridor that leads to Celadon . Known for its \u2018Global Comfort Food', Celadon gives an upscale flair to your favorites, with diners raving about the pork belly and the lemon meringue pie. Bounty Hunter Wine Bar & Smokin' BBQ is a great casual option right off Main Street for some hearty protein, with an extensive whisky menu to boot. The Grove at Copia is a Mediterranean-inspired restaurant serving shareable dishes and a great brunch spot. If you want a more casual breakfast, stop at Monday Bakery . They offer fresh pastries daily, or you can make a custom order, and their menu has savory items for those without a sweet tooth. Angele Restaurant & Bar is a long-running brasserie serving French fare on the Napa River, and remains one of Napa's most popular restaurants to this day. For those who might be finding it difficult to decide (decision fatigue is real), sample a little bit of everything instead at the Oxbow Public Market , which features favorites such as Hog Island Oyster Bar , Gott's Roadside , The Fatted Calf , and Kara's Cupcakes . Where to Stay Courtesy of Milliken Creek Inn & Spa After all the indulging and activity of Napa River, you'll want somewhere close by to lay your head at night. Treat yourself to a stay at the Andaz Napa , which offers modern, elegantly-proportioned rooms for you and your pooch. It's located in the heart of downtown Napa, so after you're done walking along the river and sampling wine at some dog-friendly tasting rooms, check-in for an in-room spa service, while your fur-baby lounges nearby on the complimentary doggie bed, snacking on the complimentary doggie treats. Nearby is the Napa River Inn , located just off Main Street. Luxuriate in glittering views of the Napa River while enjoying the complimentary pastries from Sweetie Pies, delivered fresh to your room daily. Milliken Creek Inn & Spa isn't much further from downtown Napa, but this serene setting can feel like a world away, whether you're strolling through the beautifully landscaped grounds, or enjoying the view from the grassy river banks with a drink in hand and good company by your side. \u2014 10 Places to Stay in Downtown Napa \u2014 \u2014 Napa Valley On A Budget \u2014 Author Julia Chang Julia Chang is a writer based out of San Francisco, California.

        "title": "Bottle Shock: Fact vs. Fiction",
        "text": "A favorite amongst wine lovers, Bottle Shock follows the story of Chateau Montelena winning the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976. This monumental event changed the landscape of the winemaking industry and introduced Northern California as one of the premier wine-growing regions in the world. The film follows wine expert Steven Spurrier (played by Alan Rickman) stumbling upon Chateau Montelena and its owner Jim Barrett (played by Bill Pullman), and Barrett's son, Bo (played by Chris Pine). Spurrier is shocked to discover the now award-winning Chardonnay and is determined to get the wine back to Paris for the blind taste testing. As with any movie based on a true story, you may be asking yourself, how true is it? We'll break down for you what is fact and what got the Hollywood treatment. FACT: Playfully portrayed by Chris Pine, Bo Barrett, the son of Chateau Montelena's winemaker Jim Barrett, is an unruly California surfer dude who frustrated his father due to his low ambition. Bo was indeed a surfer and a rebel in the early 1970s, but he has since lived up to the elder Barrett's hopes: Bo is currently the CEO of Chateau Montelena and has been involved in every vintage at the winery since 1972. FICTION: The father-and-son duo were a bit less physically violent than the film leads viewers to believe. There is no boxing ring on the Barrett property or in the vineyards, nor did Jim and Bo ever box each other. FICTION: Though he ended up owning the historic Chateau Montelena Winery, Jim Barrett did not craft the wine that went on to win big in France. Mike Grgich , a Croatian-American winemaker in Napa Valley, was actually the winemaker of the 1973 Chardonnay that won the Paris Tasting of 1976, known as the Judgment of Paris . While originally written into the script, Mike was cut from the movie because he did not want to be a part of the film. FICTION: In the film, the Chardonnay turns brown for 24 hours after bottling, a twist that devastates Jim, who believes his new release is doomed. Though the wine did turn off-color for a short time after it was bottled, this is actually a somewhat common occurrence, and real-life winemaker Mike Grgich totally knew how to handle the situation. FICTION: Jim and Bo are shown living at the Napa Valley winery during the summer of 1976, but they actually lived much further south, near Los Angeles, and took long trips up the coast in order to operate Chateau Montelena. Jim was actually a certified pilot, and he often flew into the nearby Santa Rosa airport when he had to spend time at the winery. FACT: Bo and Gustavo Brambila, played by Freddy Rodriguez, are portrayed as close friends, with Bo as the prankster and Gustavo as the serious one. The two struck up a friendship in the 1970s, although Gustavo was not actually involved at all with Chateau Montelena's win at the Paris Wine Tasting. Gustavo, one of the first Latinos to earn a degree in fermentation science from the University of California, Davis, was hired by winemaker Mike Grgich to do quality control in 1976, although it was after the famed tasting. Bo and Gustavo remain close friends to this day. FICTION: In the film, Gustavo is fired by Jim for producing wine under his own label. However, Gustavo was never fired, but instead left the winery on good terms. He actually left in 1977 to work for Mike when the former Chateau Montelena winemaker created his own brand, Grgich Hills . In 1996, Gustavo did go on to create his own label, Gustavo Wine, which continues to operate to this day. All in all, Bottle Shock is fairly faithful to the true story, although some people, like Mike Grgich, made major contributions that weren't included. Nevertheless, you can still experience some of Napa Valley's history through this movie. Of course, you likely won't be able to enjoy the winning 1973 Chateau Montelena Chardonnay, but it's still fun to sip one of the winery's current releases, or perhaps one from Grgich Hills Cellar or Gustavo Wines, while watching.

        "title": "The Best Winery Tours in Napa Valley",
        "text": "With more than 400 wineries throughout the region, picking the best winery tours in Napa Valley can be, simply put, a bit daunting. Luckily, we've combined our insider knowledge with the top online reviews to put together a list of the best of the best, so you can focus on what matters most \u2014 the wine. Here are the best winery tours to experience in Napa Valley. Please The Palate Courtesy of Sequoia Grove Sequoia Grove 8338 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 944-2945 Founded in 1979, this family-owned winery in Rutherford is located in a 110-year-old barn surrounded by, as the name implies, a grove of Sequoia trees. As a Napa Green Certified Winery, sustainability in and out of the winery is of the utmost importance, which is reflected through everything from the drought-tolerant landscaping to powering the winery with renewable energy. While Sequoia Grove offers a Current Release Tasting and a Single-Vineyard Tasting, it's worth planning ahead to book the A Taste of Cabernet experience. Featuring four gourmet bites thoughtfully created by the in-house chef to complement a selection of top-tier and reserve Cabernet wines, it's a tasty study in how Cabernet-based wines can gracefully pair with much more than just red meat. Insider Tip: No need to limit the wine pairings to just your visit. You can become your own chef and sommelier at home thanks to the wide assortment of recipes and pairings available on Sequoia Grove's website, from pimento cheese dip with cabernet franc to lamb bolognese with cabernet sauvignon. Sparkle On Courtesy of Mumm Mumm Napa 8445 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (800) 688-6272 Mumm Napa has been a destination for traditionally-made sparkling wines since its inception in the late 1970s. During the two-hour-long Capture the Sparkle Tour , you'll visit the winery's demonstration vineyard, tour the winemaking facility and cellar, then finish with a tasting on the Oak Terrace. If you'd rather have a more leisurely experience without the tour, book a tasting on the Oak Terrace or their Outdoor Patio to sip bubbly outdoors overlooking the vines. Insider Tip: Visit Mumm Napa's Fine Art Gallery. The gallery is home to a collection of original Ansel Adams prints (on loan from the Adams family), as well as works from local and international artists. Historic Caves Courtesy of Rutherford Hill Winery Rutherford Hill Winery 200 Rutherford Hill Road, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 963-1871 Founded in 1972, Rutherford Hill Winery was one of the earliest pioneers of Merlot in Napa Valley and, not surprisingly, Merlot remains its flagship wine. Head to this historic hillside estate to sample Merlot and Bordeaux varietal wines while enjoying panoramic views of the region, but if you want to delve deeper into Rutherford Hill's history, then book the ATV Vineyard and Cave Tour . This 90-minute experience will take you up the hill of the estate to take in the view of the Rutherford Bench and then you'll cruise down for a tour of the cave, which, at nearly a mile long, is one of the most extensive cave systems in the area.

        "title": "10 Best Dog-friendly Wineries in Napa Valley",
        "text": "Visiting a Napa Valley winery is always a good time, but it's an even better time when your trusty companion is by your side (or, at least at your feet). These days, a lot of people enjoy traveling to Wine Country with their pets, even if the destination is only an afternoon at a winery. That's why we sniffed out these dog-friendly wineries in Napa Valley, where your pampered pet is allowed to join in the wine tasting festivities. It's important to note that at most pet-friendly wineries, your dog will need to remain leashed and won't be allowed in the tasting room, wine cave, or cellar. However, as long as Fifi or Fido is well-behaved and considerate (no barking at other guests or dogs, please), these Napa wineries happily welcome you and your faithful four-legged friend to enjoy a taste of the good life, and maybe even a biscuit or two. Where to Enjoy Pet-friendly Wine Tastings in Napa Valley Tamber Bey Vineyards Courtesy of Tamber Bey You and your dog will both enjoy saddling up to the picturesque Tamber Bey Vineyards located at Sundance Ranch in Calistoga, home to the largest horse facility in Napa Valley. While there, not only will you be able to sip Bordeaux-style blends and premium single-vineyard estate wines, but you can say hello to the horses, both high-performance Arabians, as well as some that have been rescued from abuse and neglect. Your dog will love it because there's lots of outdoor space and even a dog park. Plus, they will get plenty of water and tasty food. Feeling left out? Don't. At Tamber Bey you have the option of adding a cookie pairing to your tasting. Bone appetit! 1251 Tubbs Lane, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-2100 Napa Cellars Courtesy of Facebook: Napa Cellars Enjoy a relaxing afternoon with your dog at Napa Cellars \u2018 picnic grounds. Play games and taste some of the best wines Napa has to offer while overlooking the vines. You can bring food or choose from their selection of local cheeses, oils, and jams. At Napa Cellars, it is their priority that all who visit leave content, including your pup. The pet-friendly tasting room comes with a complimentary Pampered Pooch package, which includes a wine bottle of water, a water bowl, treats, and a Napa Cellars bandana. 7481 St. Helena Highway South, Oakville, CA 94562, (707) 944-2565 Pine Ridge Vineyards Courtesy of Facebook: Pine Ridge Vineyards Pine Ridge Vineyards , known for its elegant Cabernet Sauvignon wines, offers traditional tastings, but if you're bringing your pup, \u201cBottle Service and Picnic in the Garden\u201d is a great option. Your group will have a dedicated seating area in the estate gardens where you can pour your own wine and relax. Your dog (who must be leashed and well-behaved) will be happy to have a shady spot in the grass and will get a bowl of water, upon request (and perhaps a belly scratch as well). 5901 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (800) 575-9777 Migration Courtesy of Migration Migration \u2018s idyllic winery and tasting room in Carneros is an airy, relaxed place to taste the winery's Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sparkling wines.

In addition to tasting flights for the adults, Migration offers Barkuterie boards for doggie guests. The plate includes a Migration biscuit, duck sausages, and other treats. All you have to do is ask your host to add it to your tasting! 1451 Stanly Lane, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 415-2298 Chimney Rock Winery Courtesy of Chimney Rock Winery Chimney Rock is one of just a few wineries that produces all Stags Leap District estate-grown Cabernets, which is why it's a must-visit if you like Cabernet Sauvignon. While you're sitting on the shaded patio and sipping your way through those richly textured wines, your (leashed) dog can take a nap or rehydrate (dog bowls with water are provided). Want to explore the property full of stunning South African architecture or go inside the tasting room? Your pooch is welcome there as well. Even your kids can join this Napa excursion; just be sure to include them all in your reservation. 5350 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 257-2641 Trefethen Family Vineyards Courtesy of Trefethen The family-owned and operated Trefethen is the only 19th-century wooden three-level, gravity-flow winery still surviving in Napa Valley. While your pup may not be interested in winemaking processes, learning about how gravity-flow production uses gravity to move wine around more gently than if pumps and other machines are involved, he will at least be happy that he is allowed to accompany you while you taste through the \u201cessentials,\u201d small lots,\u201d \u201call reds,\u201d or \u201cseasonal\u201d flights, so long as he stays on leash. 1160 Oak Knoll Avenue, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 255-7700 HALL Wines Courtesy of HALL Wines If your dog goes nuts when he sees rabbits, shield his eyes from the \u201cHALLmark\u201d giant Bunny Foo-Foo sculpture at the entrance of this St. Helena winery in Napa Valley, known for its Cabernet Sauvignons, Merlots, Sauvignon Blancs, and contemporary art pieces spread across the property. Dogs aren't allowed inside the buildings at HALL , which means not all tours and tastings are possible, but you can enjoy tastings outside on the patio, as well as hang out and relax on the Great Lawn. (While HALL is dog-friendly, please note that dogs are only allowed at the St. Helena location, not the Rutherford location.) 401 St. Helena Highway South, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 967-2626 Tres Sabores Winery Courtesy of Tres Sabores Winery When you arrive at this family-owned and women-led winery in St. Helena, you and your pup will be greeted by a fluffy, four-legged welcoming committee of three friendly Golden Retrievers: Cava, Bouzy Rouge, and Brilla. If you're lucky, the newest addition to the Tres Sabores Winery, Fi-Fi, will also join the party. After you've told everyone what good girls and boys they are, you can enjoy a tasting of Tres Sabores' Zinfandels, Cabernet Sauvignons, and Petite Sirahs, while your dog (who should be on a leash) enjoys fresh water, treats, and pets. All tastings are intimate and hands-on and require an appointment. (And kids can come along, as well.) 1620 S. Whitehall Lane, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 967-8027 Honig Vineyard & Winery Courtesy of Honig The folks at Honig say, \u201cWe're dog friendly as long as your dog is friendly\u201d \u2014 a fair trade, indeed. As far as wine tasting goes, this family-owned Napa winery focuses solely on its (very popular) Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon, but is also committed to environmentally sound practices, which makes a visit not only unique but educational. Your leashed dog may even learn a thing or two as the winegrowers at Honig use golden retriever \u201csniffer dogs\u201d to detect vine mealybugs, which are nearly invisible to the naked eye but can do major damage to a vineyard. 850 Rutherford Road, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 963-4272 Frog's Leap Winery Courtesy of Frog's Leap Winery Frog's Leap Winery is serious about wine but with a sense of humor.

        "text": "All aboard The Napa Valley Wine Train ! One of the most unique and enchanting experiences in Napa Valley, the wine train offers guests a trip to the past while showing you the best of what Napa Valley has to offer today. On your 36-mile round trip from Napa to St. Helena and back, you'll experience gourmet cuisine, stunning views, and stops at wineries. With its refurbished, vintage pull cars, lush detailing, and romantic setting, you'll fall in love with the bygone era of locomotive travel that the Napa Valley Wine Train preserves. Here is everything you need to know about this one-of-a-kind experience. 1. The train is also a gourmet restaurant Though the thrill of the ride is a huge part of the experience, the train is primarily a rolling gourmet restaurant featuring a changing seasonal menu that highlights fresh, local ingredients (all prepared in the train's two onboard kitchens). From tuna tartar to roasted beef tenderloin, expect to dine on decadent courses of gourmet, Napa-style fare. In the spirit of Wine Country, an extensive onboard wine list is available for lunch and dinner, offering 40 different wines. You can even bring your own wine aboard, but just know you'll have to pay a corkage fee. 2. Yes, the wine train makes stops at famous wineries Courtesy of Charles Krug First-time visitors are encouraged to try The Legacy Experience , which includes a multi-course gourmet lunch during an hour-and-a-half-long journey to two of Napa Valley's most famous wineries, Charles Krug Winery and V. Sattui. The Legacy Experience makes its first stop at the historic Charles Krug Winery, the oldest winery in Napa Valley. Guests will enjoy a private tour and tasting at the winery, which is the birthplace of California wine tasting as we know it (Charles Krug opened the first tasting room in the state), before heading to the whimsical winery that is V. Sattui. One of the first wineries to offer a wine tasting experience, you'll enjoy their award-winning small batch wines amongst the Italianate architecture and lush gardens.

The car's open-air windows provide an eye-catching panoramic view of the passing scenery as the train glides through the valley. Children's rates are only available for select packages, so be sure to call ahead. 4.

With its plush interiors, exquisitely prepared food, and unobstructed views from every angle, Vista Dome is a nod to the glory days of luxury rail travel. 5. You can get married on the train With its upscale culinary offerings and gorgeous vintage setting, the train is also a distinctive way for romantic couples to tie the knot. Small, intimate elopements can be conducted on the back of the moving train as it glides along the rails under Napa Valley's lush sweeping scenery. Or, make reservations for larger groups in a single car or throughout the entire train. The train has everything needed to bring the vision of your special event to life. 6. The train journeys to the North Pole during winter During the winter holiday season, the Wine Train transforms into the Santa Train, welcoming kids of all ages to enjoy games, singing, and live entertainment as it makes its way north to the \u201cNorth Pole.\u201d This interactive musical journey is complete with hot cocoa, freshly-baked cookies, and, of course, Santa himself, and is surely a treat for the whole family. 7.

You might solve a murder while riding the rails For a fun and completely unforgettable fine dining and entertainment experience, book a seat on the train's Murder Mystery dining tour , which operates on select dinner trains year-round. Don your best 1920s attire (or regular clothes to become a private detective) for an evening of mystery, mayhem, and murder as you enjoy a three-course dinner and work to uncover all the secrets aboard the vintage train.

        "title": "10 Most Sustainable Wineries in Napa",
        "text": "Sustainability is a term that gets tossed around a lot these days, and through the noise the significance of the term can be lost. So, we wanted to recognize 10 Napa Valley wineries that have successfully achieved and maintained sustainability initiatives, and highlight what exactly about their facilities, vineyards, winemaking, production, and greater mission makes them so sustainable. Here are 10 sustainable wineries to visit in Napa Valley. Trefethen Family Vineyard Courtesy of Trefethen Family Vineyard Located in the Oak Knoll District in Napa Valley, this winery has been family-run for three generations and is considered a pioneering winery in the Napa region. When it comes to sustainability, Trefethen Family Vineyard celebrates multiple certifications and awards, including their most recent California Green Medal Environment Award for 2022. Over the years, Trefethen has decreased their carbon emissions and in 2021, it was the first winery to work with Earthly Labs to capture carbon dioxide from active fermentations, to then purify the gas and store it as a liquid to be reused in industrial applications. The vineyard also prioritizes soil health by composting and using cover crops, and offsets 100% of their electricity usage with onsite solar power. Other notable achievements are the winery's preservation of Oak wildland, with only 40 acres of their 255-acre estate planted to vine, the encouragement of biodiverse predators to control insects, and supporting restoration of a nearby stream back to preserve salmon breeding grounds. 1160 Oak Knoll Avenue, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 255-7700 Cliff Lede Vineyards Courtesy of Cliff Lede Renowned in the wine world for the estate's \u201cRock Blocks\u201d\u2014vine blocks dedicated to some of founder Cliff Lede's favorite rock songs and albums to differentiate the vineyards during redesign\u2014Cliff Lede Vineyards focuses on producing estate wines from their 60 acres in the Stags Leap District. In 2015, both their winery and vineyards were awarded with a Napa Green Certification, which recognizes farming and production methods that meet and exceed more than 20 local, state, and federal \u201cbest practices.\u201d Some of these practices include conversion to no tillage to reduce erosion between vines, recycling of winery process water for landscaping, the use of solar panels to reduce energy use by 90% and vineyard workers being employed year-round for full-time employment benefits. 1473 Yountville Cross Road, Yountville, CA 94599, (707) 944-8642 Pine Ridge Vineyards Courtesy of Pine Ridge Vineyards With such an extensive reach in Napa Valley\u2014Pine Ridge Vineyards has invested in 160 acres of estate vineyards since its founding in 1978\u2014the winery feels responsible as stewards of the land. The in-house Green Team is committed to preserving the ecosystem not just of their vineyards but of the entire region and is demonstrated by their Napa Green certification. They follow Fish Friendly Farming practices, recapture rain water, reduce erosion by winterizing vineyards, and in the summer dry season, their vineyard roads are wetted down with organic wetting agents to control road dust. They also set their lights on a timer, use drip irrigation and 89% of their material is recycled or diverted from landfills. 5901 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (800) 575-9777 HALL Wines Courtesy of HALL Wines Though HALL may be globally distinguished for its quality and award-winning wines, they are as outstanding for their WE CARE commitment; believing in responsible entrepreneurship and giving back across the four categories of community, arts, responsible business practices, and entrepreneurship. WE CARE encompasses the family's active green and sustainable initiatives across their three luxury wine brands, HALL, WALT, and BACA. Major sustainability achievements date back to 2009 when HALL's St. Helena property earned LEED Gold for its fully sustainable production facility. Since then, HALL was also awarded LEED Gold Certification for its St. Helena tasting room and high-tech production facility. HALL Family Wines' 12 Estate Vineyards are Certified Sustainable by the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance (CSWA) and three of their vineyards are certified organic by CCOF. Another detail we love, every year all employees are given 40 hours to volunteer for a charitable organization. 401 St. Helena Highway South, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 967-2626 Trinchero Family Estates Courtesy of Trinchero Napa Valley Owned and operated by the Trinchero family since 1948, this St. Helena-headquartered winery is the fourth largest winery in the U.S. and oversees more than 50 wine and spirits brands across its portfolio. Therefore, it's even more significant for them to commit to a sustainable future, which is exactly what they've done. In July 2017, Trinchero Family Estates transitioned all of its energy use to Deep Green 100% renewable energy across all 28 of its facilities and vineyards in Napa County. Trinchero ensures that all California wines are sourced from sustainably farmed vineyards and is passionate about giving back to the community where initiatives include Sutter Home for Hope and Trinity Oaks' One Bottle One Tree program. 3070 North St. Helena Highway, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 963-3104 Round Pond Estate Courtesy of Round Pond | Kiyomi Wall Since the early 1980s, Round Pond made a name in Napa Valley for its premium wine grapes sold to some of the most cult wineries in the region and for their extremely limited production of estate Cabernet Sauvignon. Following the belief that \u201csustainable wines begin in the vineyard,\u201d Round Pond Estate focuses on three prongs of sustainability\u2014people, place, and purpose. They foster a positive and educational work environment for their team working in the Napa Green Certified vineyards and established a permanent crop cover of native grasses to nourish their soils (rather than using a till system). They compost grape pomace and reuse it to replenish vineyard soils and use integrated pest management. In their buildings, Round Pond has upgraded their light fixtures to LED energy-efficient bulbs, reducing their kilowatt hours by 14%. And their purpose extends to supporting the local Napa community, which the Estate gives back to the Alzheimer's Association through funding and awareness. 875 Rutherford Road, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 302-2575 Signorello Estate Courtesy of Signorello After the winery was destroyed in the 2017 Atlas Peak Fire, Signorello committed to rebuilding not just any old winery, but a state-of-the-art facility that prioritizes the brand's eco-conscious efforts, like designing the production spaces more sustainably and focusing on renewable energy. Signorello has been farmed organically since 2008 and holds Napa Green Certified Land status. They are slowly converting to regenerative farming techniques, using sheeps and goats for weed control, planting vegetable gardens, and nurturing beehives. A few other eco-friendly farming methods include hand-picking grapes, enhancing regional watersheds, and keeping production limited to ensure the vines are developing healthfully to allow for longevity. 4500 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 255-5990 Bella Oaks Bella Oaks, Courtesy of Matt Morris Films On a mission to preserve the original Rutherford site of some of Napa's most noteworthy single-vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, proprietor Suzanne Deal Booth has already made strides in rebuilding the repertoire of the land. It all started when Deal Booth acquired the 18-acre property in 2010, as she began a lengthy turnover and regeneration process of the vineyards; vines were replanted, row orientation adjusted, and soils renewed. By 2019, Bella Oaks converted entirely to organic farming and was certified by California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF). Today, the emphasis remains on organic farming as well as biodiversity, encouraging the variety of life on the estate to keep the land surrounding the grapes healthy and thriving. 1350 Bella Oaks Lane, Napa, CA 94558 CADE Estate Winery Courtesy of CADE Estate Winery From the beginning, this estate's three founders envisioned a contemporary winery that would honor the Angwin land aesthetically and ecologically. The winery was built out of 98% recycled materials (including the naturally insulated fermentation room and tasting room that's insulated by materials like blue jeans) and was Napa Valley's first LEED Gold Certified estate winery. The Howell Mountain estate vineyard is organically farmed and certified CCOF and both the winery and the land are Napa Green Certified for achieving sustainability and conservation. 360 Howell Mountain Road S, Angwin, CA 94508, (707) 690-1213 Spottswoode Estate Courtesy of Spottswoode Known for their serendipitous story\u2014the first Cabernet Sauvignon was released in 1982, exactly 100 years after the estate's founding\u2014Spottswoode Estate honors its heritage as much as it's committed to its future. Having started organic farming in 1985, the winery is among one of the first in Napa Valley to acquire the CCOF certification (in 1992). The vineyard and winery are Napa Green Certified and the estate is Certified Biodynamic, using biodynamic specialists to ensure the vineyards and surrounding land continue to function as a living ecosystem. 1902 Madrona Avenue, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 963-0134 \u2013 Most Beautiful Wineries in Napa Valley \u2013 \u2013 Best Wineries in Calistoga \u2013 Author Jillian Dara Jillian Dara is a freelance journalist focusing on wine, spirits, travel, and culture. She loves reporting on the intersection of them all for publications including Wine Enthusiast, VinePair, SommTV and Travel + Leisure.

        "title": "Your Guide to BottleRock Napa Valley",
        "text": "Delicious food, local wine, and some of the biggest names in music together for one long weekend in Napa Valley ? Yes, please! Get excited, because the uber-popular BottleRock Napa Valley festival returns May 26 \u2013 28, 2023 to kick off summer in style, bringing amazing live music, good food, and plenty of fun together for one epic three-day festival. Here's what you need to know before you go. Tickets go fast Naturally, anything that combines live music with high quality food, craft beer, and incredible wine in the middle of Wine Country will draw crowds. And when it happens to take place over Memorial Day weekend in Napa Valley, you can bet that tickets sell out quickly. We suggest dropping what you're doing (after reading this, of course) to purchase your tickets ASAP, as 3-day tickets have already sold out for this year's event. (Then set a calendar reminder to check the BottleRock website later this year to see when tickets go on sale for 2024). Planes, trains, and automobiles Regardless of where you're coming from, you'll want to have a plan (in advance) for getting to and from the event, as missing your favorite band because you're stranded would be a major bummer. BottleRock buses operate daily from San Francisco, Sacramento, Oakland, San Jose, Fairfield, Sonoma, Mill Valley, Palo Alto, and Santa Rosa. Locally, Napa Valley's VINE Transit offers free rides and extended, late-night service all weekend, including regional express service to BART. If traveling from outside the Bay Area, you could arrive by Amtrak train or by airplane, as the Charles M. Schultz \u2013 Sonoma County Airport is right smack in the middle of Wine Country. If you do plan on driving, though, it's wise to bring your friends with you to reduce the number of cars on the road and in parking lots. Carpooling to BottleRock is way more fun, anyways. All-day street parking will be available in downtown Napa, and at the event there will be General Admission parking available for purchase, plus VIP parking, as well. Just note that there is no overnight parking in the BottleRock lots, so plan accordingly. Music, music, and more music Yes, there's great scenery. And yes, there's great food and drink. But let's be honest\u2026 BottleRock is about the music. On Friday, May 26, Post Malone, Smashing Pumpkins, Billy Strings, Lucius, Bastille, and many more will perform, while Saturday finds Lizzo, Leon Bridges, Duran Duran, and Cautious Clay taking the stage, to name just a few. On Sunday, May 28, enjoy the sounds of Lil Nas X, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Struts, Sheryl Crow, Warren G\u2026 the list goes on. Check out the full line-up here . Courtesy of BottleRock Media Spirited Libations This festival does take place in Napa Valley, so it's to be expected that the wine offerings will be top-notch. Whether reaching for a buttery Chardonnay from JaM Cellars, a bubbly delight from Mumm, or an acclaimed Cabernet Sauvignon from Duckhorn, the staff of BottleRock sommeliers and wine experts will be there to make sure your glass is always full. Not a wine drinker? There will be plenty of cold and refreshing craft beers on hand, as well as hard seltzer, craft cocktails, and yes, lots and lots of water!

        "title": "Best Way to Travel to Napa Valley",
        "text": "When visiting Napa Valley , you know you will experience a premier Wine Country adventure, so why not arrive in style? We imagine you're eager to get to your destination, so we've laid out all the best and most convenient ways to get there. Napa Valley is close to several major airports that offer convenient transportation to your destination via shuttle, train, rental car, or ferry service. With our suggestions and tips, you'll be arriving in Napa Valley with ease, ready for your first glass of wine. Courtesy of Beau Wine Tours Charles M. Schulz \u2013 Sonoma County Airport (STS) 2200 Airport Boulevard, Santa Rosa, CA 95403 Three different airline carriers offer daily non-stop service to Charles M. Schulz \u2013 Sonoma County Airport (STS) , making it easy to reach Wine Country in just a few short hours. Daily nonstop flights include: Alaska Airlines to/from Los Angeles, Burbank, Orange County, San Diego, Portland, and Seattle; American Airlines to/from Phoenix Sky Harbor and Dallas; and Avelo Airlines to/from Burbank, Las Vegas, and Palm Springs. What's also great is that if you'd like to take some wine home with you, Alaska Airlines offers their Wine Flies Free program, which, as the name suggests, allows passengers to check a case of wine for free. By far one of the best choices for transport from Sonoma to Napa Valley, Beau Wine Tours will meet you at the terminal then whisk you off to your destination in comfort. Insider Tip: Beau Wine Tours also offers fantastic wine tours in both Napa Valley and Sonoma County. We recommend the VIP dinner service where you are treated to a sunset ride with champagne from your hotel to your restaurant of choice anywhere in the valley. Courtesy of Fly SFO San Francisco International Airport (SFO) 780 S Airport Boulevard, San Francisco, CA 94128 San Francisco International Airport, located roughly 60 miles from Napa, is the largest airport in the bay area and represents a major hub for travel in and out of the city. While virtually every form of transportation service is available from SFO, we recommend taking Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) from the airport to the San Francisco Ferry Building where passengers can board the Vallejo Ferry for a relaxing and scenic trip across the Bay. From Vallejo, travelers can pick up the Napa Vine route 11 shuttle to downtown Napa. Uber is also quite ubiquitous in these parts. Not up for more public transportation? Download the app and get delivered to your hotel from the ferry for under $30. Insider Tip: Grab a hand made empanada from El Porte\u00f1o at the Ferry Building before you leave, and wash it down with a pint of Villager IPA from Fort Point Beer Company. Not hungry in SF? There are food and brewery options at the Vallejo Ferry Terminal, not to mention a bar on the ferry. Courtesy of California Wine Tours Oakland International Airport (OAK) 1 Airport Drive, Oakland, CA 94621 Budget-conscious travelers looking at alternate airports for deals and international visitors interested in bypassing the San Francisco bustle will have the option to land across the bay in Oakland. The airport itself is a bit smaller, but hosts millions of travelers per year nonetheless. OAK offers all of the usual transportation options; however, the best choice for ease and value will be California Wine Tours airport transportation service. California Wine Tours is a great way to get to Napa from OAK and they also offer private and group tours of their partnered wineries in Napa Valley and Sonoma. Sacramento International Airport, Courtesy of Visit Sacramento Sacramento International Airport (SMF) 6900 Airport Boulevard, Sacramento, CA 95837 Flying into Sacramento International Airport affords the traveler with a much more intimate airport experience than SFO and Oakland, yet still offers plenty of great dining and shopping on the premises. Getting out of the airport is easier too. Napa Shuttle & Limousine is the go to concierge and transport from California's capital city airport. In addition to providing a luxury ride to Napa Valley from the airport, they also accommodate complete wine tours for those inclined to explore wineries and restaurants in Napa Valley. Insider Tip: Wine enthusiasts eager to begin their tasting experience will want to pop into Vino Volo at the Sacramento Airport's Terminal A to sample wines from Napa, Sonoma, and beyond. Courtesy of Pure Luxury Tours Mineta San Jos\u00e9 International Airport (SJC) 1701 Airport Boulevard, San Jose, CA 95110 Wine Country explorers heading to Napa Valley via the San Jose International Airport will be greeted with a blend of art and technology indicative of Silicon Valley's contribution to innovation. Browse futuristic sculptures in the lobby, or unwind from your flight over a drink at Island Brews before heading to baggage claim. For a relaxing ride to Napa, we recommend Pure Luxury Tours to take care of your transportation needs. In addition to boasting one of the largest chauffeured fleets in the region, as a Certified Green ground transportation company, Pure Luxury's commitment to lessening the carbon impact on the environment makes them the natural choice. Insider Tip: If you decide to rent a car and drive yourself to Napa, take I-680N. Try to plan ahead and avoid morning (7am-9am) and evening (3p-7p) commute times and be sure to have $5 cash on hand for the Benicia Bridge toll. We've chosen to highlight specific routes and operators to certain destinations, but many of them offer service to all Bay Area airports. We can't wait to see you, we'll have wine waiting!

        "title": "All About Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon",
        "text": "No grape is more synonymous with Napa Valley than Cabernet Sauvignon. From the valley floor to mountain vineyards, Cabernet shows a particular fondness for Napa's sunny climate. Capable of producing wines that are both enjoyable in their youth as well as age-worthy, Cabernet flexes its range in Napa's terroir. But how did this famous French grape become a star in California? Here's a history of how Cabernet Sauvignon became the signature variety of Napa Valley, as well as a few great Napa Cabs to look out for. Cabernet Sauvignon's Roots Cabernet Sauvignon traces its roots to the Gironde in southwest France. It is an offspring of Cabernet Franc and the white variety Sauvignon Blanc. Known for its thick skins, high tannins, and relatively high acidity, it is a grape that has spread in popularity across the globe. Notes of black currant and red fruits, cassis, and pepper, and sometimes hints of dark chocolate or tobacco are hallmarks of Cabernet. History of Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley Louis M. Martini's early days, Courtesy of Gallo Cabernet Sauvignon made its California debut in the Santa Clara Valley in the mid-1800s, but didn't make its way north until the latter half of the 19th century when it was planted in Sonoma. It was considered a finicky grape but people liked its aromatics. H.W. Crabb was the first to bring it to Napa a few years later and planted it in the To Kalon Vineyard (meaning \u201chighest beauty\u201d in Greek) in what is now the Oakville AVA. The double whammy of phylloxera in the late 1880s and Prohibition in the 1920s stunted the wine industry for a time, but by 1963, Cabernet Sauvignon became the third most-planted grape in Napa, after Zinfandel and Petite Sirah. The 1970s were a time of experimentation: trials with longer maceration times proved to soften tannins, for example. The decade also saw an expansion of Cabernet plantings, but no better event exemplified all the strides made in the industry than when a Cabernet and a Chardonnay from Napa beat out French competitors in the 1976 Judgment of Paris. Another round of phylloxera in the 1980s again threatened to destroy the region, but by this time, winemakers were armed with better plant material, rootstocks, and know-how when it came to replanting. The rise of so-called \u201cCult Cabernet\u201d labels further captured wine drinkers' attention, and by 1997, Cabernet Sauvignon was the most planted variety in Napa Valley, and remains to this day. Napa Cabernet on the Label In order for a wine to be labeled \u201cCabernet,\u201d at least 75% of the cuv\u00e9e must contain this variety. Other Bordeaux varieties, such as Merlot, Petit Verdot, and Cabernet Franc, make common blending partners. And for a label to carry a \u201cNapa Valley\u201d designation , or one of the sub-appellations, 100% of the fruit must come from that AVA. What to Pair with Cabernet Courtesy of Unsplash With its medium-to-full body and high tannins, there's a reason why Cabernet is the go-to choice for steak. Any rich protein is a great match, from braised lamb shank to veal Osso Buco. But vegetables shouldn't get short shrift: Mushrooms, stewed beans\u2014even roasted brussels sprouts\u2014all stand up to Cabernet. When it comes to cheeses, cheddar and gouda create an ideal pairing. If you're ready to dig into the history of Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, here are some wines to try: Louis M. Martini, Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon After running a successful grape-growing business in San Francisco (and creating sacramental wine to sell during Prohibition), the Martini family moved north and set up shop in St. Helena in 1933. It is a winery of firsts in Napa Valley: it was one of the first to use cold fermentation; to use wind power in the vineyards; and one of the first to bottle a varietal Merlot. Charles Krug, Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon Founded in 1861, Charles Krug is considered Napa's first commercial winery and is regarded as opening the first public tasting room, to boot. Grapes for this wine come from the estate vineyards in Yountville and produce a Cabernet with ripe red berry and mocha notes. Pine Ridge, Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon The Stags Leap District, even before it became an official AVA, caught international attention when a Cabernet Sauvignon from the district took top honors\u2014over French wines\u2014in the 1976 Judgment of Paris. Today, Cabernet Sauvignon continues to be a marquee grape for the appellation and Pine Ridge's appellation-specific wine, with dark fruit and spice notes, shows why. Corison, Kronos Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon Cathy Corison is known for her elegant and textured Cabernets, and her Kronos Vineyard is the source of outstanding fruit. Vines for this single-vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon were planted in 1971 and while yields are low due to age, the grapes produce wines with depth and finesse. Lokoya, Diamond Mountain District Cabernet Sauvignon Lokoya specializes in Cabernet from mountain vineyard sites and the different bottlings show how versatile Cabernet can be at both altitude and in various terroir. Diamond Mountain is in the upper part of Napa Valley and is part of the Mayacamas Mountains. Nutrient-poor soils mean vines struggle to find nourishment, but that results in concentrated and complex fruit flavors. Schrader Cellars, Heritage Clone Cabernet Sauvignon Schrader works with some of Napa's most prestigious vineyards, such as the historic To Kalon Vineyard, for its Cabernets. The Heritage Clone comes from a specific block within the To Kalon Vineyard and, as its name suggests, a very particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon. This lush wine with beautiful acidity, a streak of minerality, and blackberry fruit is definitely a wine to age. \u2013 How to Read a Napa Valley Wine Label \u2013 \u2013 Top Wines From Napa Valley \u2013 Author Shana Clarke Shana Clarke is a freelance journalist and consultant based in New York City.

Idyllic Serenity Courtesy of Far Niente Far Niente 1350 Acacia Drive, Oakville, CA 94562, (707) 944-2861 Yelp : 4.5 stars, 197 reviews Tasting price: Starting at $90 This storied Oakville winery has long drawn visitors for its quality chardonnay and cabernet wines, but don't discount the lasting impression the picturesque property has, too. Lush gardens, sprawling vineyards, and historic wine caves create a beautiful setting from which to taste, while the stone winery building, which looks like it came straight out of a storybook, adds to the serene and magical ambiance. Even more, the name \u201cFar Niente\u201d \u2014 which is an Italian phrase translated to \u201cwithout a care\u201d \u2014 has been carved into the front of the building since it was established in 1885. Insider tip: In 1985, Far Niente launched Dolce, a late-harvest blend of sauvignon blanc and semillon, which has earned the nickname of \u201cLiquid Gold.\u201d Be sure to pick up a bottle during your visit if you're a fan of dessert wines. Peaceful Wine Country Setting Courtesy of Pine Ridge Vineyards Pine Ridge Vineyards 5901 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (800) 575-9777 Yelp : 4.5 stars, 350 reviews Tasting price: Starting at $55 Founded in 1978, Pine Ridge Vineyards is a picturesque winery in the heart of the Stags Leap District, where intimate tastings and tours feature stunning views of their sustainable vineyards and the surrounding hills. Sample the winery's elegant cabernet sauvignon wines from the relaxed setting of the shaded patio or picnic grounds, making time to explore the demonstration vineyard to get a closer look at the vines, or opt for one of the cave tasting experiences which will find you touring the winery's vast European-inspired caves. Insider tip: Pine Ridge Vineyards isn't just dedicated to producing quality estate wine from their vineyards throughout the Stags Leap, Howell Mountain, Oakville, Rutherford, and Carneros appellations, they are also fully committed to sustainability in all facets of winery operations. The Napa Green Certified Winery is proud that 89 percent of their material is recycled or diverted from landfills, while all of their estate vineyards are Napa Green Certified Land, as well \u2014 each with a fully customized conservation program to encourage and protect biodiversity. Most Regal Ch\u00e2teau Courtesy of Domaine Carneros Domaine Carneros 1240 Duhig Road, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 257-0101 Yelp : 4 stars, 2514 reviews Tasting price: Starting at $40 There's a reason why this stunning estate is so popular amongst visitors \u2014 Domaine Carneros is home to the most majestic ch\u00e2teau in Napa Valley. Inspired by the 18th century Ch\u00e2teau de la Marquetterie in Champagne, France, guests are invited to enjoy their sparkling and still wines in the Louis XV-inspired salon or on the terrace overlooking the vines while contemplating what it must feel like to be born into French royalty. Insider tip: Try the winery's curated food & wine pairing, Bubbles & Bites, which showcases the versatility of sparkling wine paired with food. The current offering, A Journey to Spain, features a selection of savory and sweet Spanish-inspired bites paired with some of Domaine Carneros' top-rated sparkling wines. Most Serene Terrace Courtesy of Round Pond Estate Round Pond Estate 875 Rutherford Road, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 302-2575 Yelp : 4 stars, 302 reviews Tasting price: Starting at $60 The moment you arrive to the palm-lined driveway of this beautiful Rutherford estate, you know you're in for a treat. Inspired by Old World Italian hospitality, most of Round Pond's tasting experiences take place outside on the inviting covered terrace overlooking the vines, where estate-grown wines are accompanied by artisanal bites prepared with ingredients grown on-site, including their estate-made olive oil. Insider Tip: There are few places in Northern California where you can taste wine and estate olive oil in one place, but at Round Pond you can do just that. One of two working olive mills in Napa Valley, Round Pond offers tours of the mill, which include guided tastings of their estate olive oils and vinegars. It's the perfect interlude between wine tastings. Historic Grandeur Courtesy of Stags' Leap Winery Stags' Leap Winery 6150 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 257-5790 Yelp : 4 stars, 247 reviews Tasting price: Starting at $85 Situated along the Silverado Trail in the heart of the famed Stags Leap District is the historic Stags' Leap Winery. With roots tracing back to 1893, the picturesque 19th century stone winery is worthy of a visit in its own right, featuring buildings with castle-like details, coffered ceilings, and stained glass windows, but add in an impressive portfolio of cabernets and it's no wonder why this storied property has remained a top destination in Wine Country for years and years. Insider tip: If it's a nice day (which is most of the time in Napa Valley!), you may want to book the Porch Tasting. Offered daily starting at 10:30 AM, this seated tasting experience on the porch of the Manor House is sure to transport you back in time to the elegant early days of Wine Country. An Iconic Spot for Art, Food & Wine Courtesy of Robert Mondavi Winery Robert Mondavi Winery 7801 St. Helena Highway, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 226-1395 Yelp : 4 stars, 1194 reviews Tasting price: Starting at $65 Appreciation of art, food, and wine were a core part of Robert Mondavi's life philosophy and the winery he built is an homage to all three. Once you pass the seven-foot-tall Robert Mondavi sculpture that flanks the half-moon entryway of this iconic Mission-style winery, you'll be able to experience the passion that Robert Mondavi had for the Napa Valley region. Insider tip: Food and wine go hand-in-hand at Mondavi, so you can bet the winery does both well. Consider springing for one of the culinary tasting experiences on offer, such as the Vineyard to Table Lunch. Available daily, this leisurely lunch on the patio includes thoughtfully composed, locally-sourced dishes paired with estate wines and vineyard views. A Rich History Courtesy of Inglenook Inglenook 1991 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 968-1161 Yelp : 4 stars, 390 reviews Tastings: Starting at $60 This historic Napa Valley winery, founded in 1879, is owned by Francis Ford Coppola and family, who purchased part of the winery in 1975 and the remainder in 1995, and have since restored the stately Ch\u00e2teau and grounds to grandeur. Surrounded by vine-covered pergolas, lush trees, fountains, and 1,700 acres of vines, it's a beautiful place to taste their iconic Rutherford wines. Insider tip: Those interested in exploring the rich legacy of Inglenook will want to reserve the Private Library Experience, a guided walking tour of the estate culminating in a seated library wine and cheese tasting in the winery's historic cellar. Mountainside Splendor Courtesy of Mayacamas Vineyards Mayacamas Vineyards & Winery 1155 Lokoya Road, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 224-4030 Yelp : 4 stars, 18 reviews Tasting price: $125 per person at the Estate ($30+ at the Downtown Napa location) Founded in 1889, Mayacamas Vineyards has long been recognized as a top producer of age-worthy Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay wines, which are carefully made using traditional winemaking techniques. Situated high above the valley, a visit to their mountainside property is a special treat, where a tour of the historic grounds is followed by an al fresco tasting alongside breathtaking views you won't forget. Insider tip: While it won't be quite the same experience as visiting the winery, you can sample the wines of Mayacamas at a fraction of the price by visiting their downtown Napa tasting room \u2014 a chic space in which to taste a selection of current releases and library wines. \u2013 Napa Valley's Historic Wineries in Two Days \u2013 \u2013 The Most Luxurious Hotels in Napa Valley \u2013 Author WineCountry Staff LOVE THIS CONTENT?

        "title": "The Perfect Napa Valley Itinerary for First-Time Visitors",
        "text": "One hour north of San Francisco, all of life's greatest indulgences \u2014 wine, food, relaxation, and adventure \u2014 can be experienced all at once in Napa Valley, one of the top Wine Country destinations in the world. Thirty miles long and five miles wide, this small slice of heaven is home to more than 500 wineries throughout a collection of six quaint towns: Napa, Yountville, Oakville, Rutherford, St. Helena, and Calistoga. Each has its own personality and places to discover; from Napa's urban wine trail to Yountville's renowned fine dining to Calistoga's detoxifying hot springs, there's something for every kind of traveler, whether you're a oenophile, foodie, adventurist, or self-care aficionado. There is also not a bad time to visit Napa Valley. While September and October are the busiest and warmest months, offering the chance to experience the annual grape harvest in action, the winter months have their own appeal. It's quiet, uncrowded, and not too chilly with temperatures mostly hanging out in the 50s and 60s. Plus, many hotels offer hard-to-beat off-season rates. Your best chance of rain is in the spring, but the blooming fields of bright, yellow mustard also make it one of the most Instagram-worthy seasons to plan a trip. For whenever you do decide to pack your bags and pay Napa Valley a visit, we've put together the perfect itinerary for the first time visitor, covering all of the \u201cmust do's\u201d over a long weekend trip. Day 1 Visit a Historic Winery Courtesy of Louis M. Martini Winery / Kristen Cropper You can't visit Napa Valley without a trip to some of the area's most historic and famous wineries where this great wine region began to make its mark on the world. From Napa, head north on scenic Highway 128 toward St. Helena, first stopping at Rutherford's Beaulieu Vineyard , one of the longest continually operating wineries in Napa Valley, before making your way to Louis M. Martini Winery to admire the renovated space while you sip. Other historically-significant winery stops worth considering include Beringer , Charles Krug (Napa Valley's oldest winery), and Stag's Leap Wine Cellars , where you'll be able to taste iconic wines while discovering more about Napa's winemaking heritage at each stop. Explore Downtown Napa Courtesy of Fieldwork Brewing After a day of wine tasting, make your way back to Napa, where you'll be able to explore on foot. Stroll over to the Oxbow Public Market , where you can shop from a myriad of local vendors for souvenirs and gifts. You can also grab a pre-dinner snack\u2014think, oysters from Hog Island Oyster Co ., a mini Sweet S'mores or Chocolate Velvet cupcake from Kara's Cupcakes , or housemade sourdough bagels from the new Loveski Deli . Thirsty? Grab a pint at Fieldwork Brewing Company . Next, cross over the First St. Bridge to the main part of Downtown Napa. Here you can stop in at one of the many wine tasting rooms, wine bars, or restaurants for happy hour. We love Cadet , Carpe Diem , and Compline wine bars for pre-dinner drinks. Make a reservation for dinner on the Napa Riverfront at the famous Morimoto or the romantic French bistro Angele , or head to The Grove at CIA to dine on Mediterranean-inspired cuisine under olive trees in the garden. Stay Courtesy of Facebook: Andaz Napa Reserve a hotel room in Napa so that you can be within walking distance (or just a short drive) to downtown's many restaurants, bars, and tasting rooms. The urban chic Andaz Napa is at the heart of downtown Napa activity, where loft-style rooms are both stylish and inviting, while Milliken Creek 's peaceful riverfront location offers guests a quieter escape just a few minutes from the downtown scene. Also close to downtown Napa is the Cambria Hotel , a newer hotel featuring comfortable rooms and great amenities at a more approachable price point. Day 2 Spend your second day exploring the towns that put the \u201cValley\u201d in \u201cNapa Valley.\u201d The small towns of Yountville, Oakville, Rutherford, St. Helena, and Calistoga are referred to by locals as the \u201cUpValley,\u201d so use that term if you want to blend in. Breakfast in Yountville Courtesy of Bouchon Bakery For breakfast, head to chef Thomas Keller's famous Bouchon Bakery in Yountville for pastries and espresso. Most likely there will be a line out the door, but it moves quickly. If you want to double down, you can head to Mini Model across the street. This is a smaller location of the locally-acclaimed Model Bakery . Get the English muffin. It's so good that Oprah Winfrey actually has them flown in to her. For a more leisurely breakfast, try Lucy Restaurant at the LEED Certified Bardessono , where breakfast options highlight what's local and seasonal. Visit a Boutique Winery Courtesy of Sequoia Grove Winery / Dakota Moffitt Because you visited some of the oldest, largest, and most popular wineries on Day 1, make an appointment at a boutique or family-owned winery next and compare experiences. A boutique winery can mean several things: a more personalized experience (sometimes with the winemaker or owner), less of a crowd, and super primo wines (especially Cabernet Sauvignon, which Napa Valley is best known for). Some of our favorite family-owned and boutique wineries to visit UpValley are Goosecross Cellars , Jessup Cellars , and Cliff Lede Vineyards in Yountville, William Cole in St. Helena, and Staglin Family Vineyard in Rutherford. Also in Rutherford is the family-owned Sequoia Grove Winery , where a variety of tasting experiences await. Add a seasonal cheese and charcuterie plate to your tasting if you need a snack to tide you over until lunch. Lunch at Gott's Roadside Courtesy of Gott's Roadside For lunch, continue to head north and pull over at the original Gott's Roadside location in St. Helena. Formerly Taylor's Automatic Refresher, when Gott's took over, they kept the old, 50s-style roadside building, now a Napa Valley landmark. There may be a line here too, but the burgers and shakes are a can't-miss. Gott's is located at the gateway of St. Helena's charming Main Street, so you can walk your meal off afterwards with some window shopping at the local boutiques. Relax and Recharge in Calistoga Courtesy of Dr. Wilkinson's Backyard Resort & Mineral Springs For the better part of the afternoon, drive the eight miles from St. Helena to Calistoga for some spa time. This quirky, little town is best known for its healing mineral waters from natural hot springs, plus mud baths that'll make your skin as smooth as a newborn. Make an appointment for a spa treatment ahead of time; there are so many local spas to choose from, from super luxe resorts like Indian Springs and Solage to hip boutique gems like Dr. Wilkinson's Backyard Resort & Mineral Springs to more intimate and classically restorative escapes at The Moonacre Spa and Golden Haven Hot Springs . If you have some time after, take a stroll down Calistoga's main drag Lincoln Avenue and pop into CAMi Art + Wine for a tasting while admiring the contemporary art, or grab a pint at the Calistoga Inn Restaurant & Brewery . Dine at a World-Renowned Restaurant Courtesy of Acacia House For your last supper of the trip, go big and make a reservation at one of Napa Valley's finest dining establishments from an acclaimed chef. In Yountville, choose from Michael Chiarello's Bottega , or Thomas Keller's The French Laundry (if you can get in and money is no issue) or Ad Hoc . St. Helena is home to PRESS \u2013one of our favorites for exceptional food and wine\u2013as well as Christopher Kostow's The Charter Oak , Chris Cosentino's Acacia House , and Charlie Palmer's Harvest Table . Wherever you end up, you won't leave hungry or disappointed. Stay Courtesy of Facebook: The Wine Country Inn & Cottages Book a hotel UpValley for the second night of your trip. For a true Wine Country getaway among the vines, snag a room at the intimate Wine Country Inn & Cottage ; for something more contemporary and convenient, check out the Wydown Hotel on St. Helena's Main Street. Day 3 Take Flight in a Hot Air Balloon Courtesy of Facebook: Napa Valley Balloons Schedule your travel plans home later in the day so that you have time for one last hurrah. One of Napa Valley's most sought-after adventures is a sunrise hot air balloon ride over the vines. We promise that the 6 AM wake up call is worth it. Don't forget your camera! Check out Napa Valley Aloft or Napa Valley Balloons, Inc . to schedule your flight, which often includes a post-flight sparkling wine toast. If soaring above the valley isn't your thing and you'd prefer to fit in another winery visit or two, don't miss sampling the Bordeaux-styled red wines of Conn Creek Winery in Rutherford, or exploring the caves and distinct wines of Pine Ridge Vineyards , situated in the heart of the Stags Leap District. \u2014 New in Napa Valley 2023 \u2014 \u2014 Best Restaurants in Napa Valley \u2014 Author Jess Lander Jess Lander is a freelance wine, food and travel writer based in Napa Valley and exploring all things California wine country.

        "text": "Have you noticed? Napa Valley is shapeshifting. Despite a longstanding reputation as opulent and otherworldly, the place has begun to show a more approachable side\u2014one that's equal parts grace and grit. Even as natural disasters have tested the region, its welcoming spirit of hospitality shines. Gazing into our crystal ball, we predict that 2023 will reveal more of the \u201creal\u201d Napa Valley, along with its escapist indulgences. The future looks bright. What's New in Napa Valley 2023 Stay. Courtesy of Brannan Cottage Inn As vacation digs go, you can't get any cozier than the stylish, six-room Brannan Cottage Inn . Housed in a 150-year-old cottage built by the founder of Calistoga, the property was restored and updated with luxury amenities in the summer of 2022. Its prime location allows you to walk to downtown Calistoga in 10 minutes, or venture a little further (15 minutes) by car to find peace outdoors at Robert Louis Stevenson State Park. Before setting off on your Napa explorations, grab a coffee at the adjacent Sam's General Store . The popular coffee shop offers an array of gourmet sandwiches and snacks, which you can request packed into a picnic for your day's adventures. Eat. Courtesy of Morimoto Asia A culinary legend needing little introduction, Chef Masaharu Morimoto\u2014a.k.a., the \u201cIron Chef\u201d\u2014has recently blessed downtown Napa with a second eatery. Lively and welcoming, Morimoto Asia is situated on the Napa River, just down the block from the existing sushi restaurant, Morimoto Napa. Its 170 seats are arranged in both intimate and communal tables, while its cuisine features \u201cFar East tastes and textures\u201d including traditional hot pot, tender dumplings, flavorful rice and noodle dishes, and more. Kick off your feast with a lychee-tini (sake, vodka, and lychee liqueur) and crab rangoon appetizer; then try the richly flavored crepe okonomiyaki, a flavorful dish that Morimoto created based on his favorite childhood meal. A recent visit to C Casa , the beloved taco stop at Oxbow Public Market, found its former food stall empty, inducing panic that (heaven forbid) the place had closed. Turns out, they had moved to a spacious new fine-dining restaurant a few paces away. C Casa's expansive new menu offers something for everyone. Dine on formal dishes like duck confit dressed with oranges and avocado crema; light meals like the fresh Dungeness crab salad with grapefruit; or casual eats like Mexican street corn. Drinks options abound, from a tasty grilled-pineapple margarita, to innovative zero-proof selections like a prickly pear and ginger spritzer. Forum at Meadowood, Courtesy of Meadowood Any time of day\u2014from breakfast to cocktail hour to dinner\u2014you'll find a relaxed yet elegant meal at Forum , which opened its doors as part of recent renovations at Meadowood, the 250-acre luxury resort in St. Helena. Showcasing seasonal produce from the on-site estate garden, the farm-to-table restaurant offers a true taste of the Napa Valley. Start the day with pumpkin pancakes or cold-pressed juice and an acai bowl. Later, try a crispy pork belly sandwich or local chicken cooked in Lebanese spices. Savor it all on an ambient outdoor patio bedecked with twinkling lights. Ahh. Drink. Courtesy of Facebook: Compline Good news: Compline , the Michelin-starred wine bar and restaurant in downtown Napa, has added a retail shop and wine club to their already wildly successful operation. Now you can bring a taste of Compline home: order the restaurant's popular duck fat fries and burger online, swing by to pick up your take-out food, and add a bottle to pair with your take-out meal. Choose from a variety of wine styles and price points ranging from unsung indie brands to highly coveted classics, all curated by veteran sommeliers and owners Matt Stamp and Ryan Stetins. An undisputed force in California winemaking, Robert Mondavi Winery has been part of the glimmering fabric of Napa Valley since 1966. With Director of Winemaking Sally Johnson Blum, who took her post in the summer of 2022, the winery turns a whole new page. Look for her first releases, along with exclusive events hosted by Blum, as the year unfolds. Courtesy of New Frontier Wine Co.

Depot Provisions offers all the goods you could possibly need to survive a day in Wine Country: locally made cheese, charcuterie, prepared foods, and (of course) wine. As the Depot evolves in the coming year, expect to find luxe lifestyle boutiques, a distillery, and a microbrewery. Experience. Courtesy of Hess Persson Estate Those in the know are already savvy to Hess Persson Estate , the winery and vineyard situated outside of Napa on the flanks of Mount Veeder. Offering estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon along with a world-class art collection, Hess Persson is no mere pit stop on your wine tasting itinerary\u2014it's a destination all its own, worthy of a full day's exploration. Its latest attraction is a personal tasting with in-house chocolatier Jason Collins, who will guide you and your party in making your own souvenir chocolate bar. Once you've had your fill of wine and sweets, wander the gallery, and don't miss the ethereal sculptures from iconic artist Andy Goldsworthy. Looking ahead: Keep an eye on the Meritage Resort and Spa , which was just approved for major expansion. While it may take a couple of years for this development to unfold, it appears that we can anticipate a new hotel and residences, as well. The renovations begin with a pop-up French bistro in the summer of 2023. Stay tuned! \u2013 Unique Wine Pairings in Napa \u2013 \u2013 Best Restaurants in Napa Valley \u2013 Author A.E. Cook A.E.

And, when in Napa Valley, one can always expect the eating and drinking part will include some of the best food and wine available.

        "title": "Napa Valley Cult Wineries to Know",
        "text": "In Napa Valley , \u201ccult\u201d associations aren't necessarily a negative thing\u2014in regards to wines and wineries that is. The label of cult wineries is often thrown around in the Valley as an elite title reflecting a winery with limited production of high quality wines and a dedicated following. Many of these cult wineries sell out of their vintages in days and have years-long waiting lists for memberships. Oh, and because of these traits, high price points are a standard of cult wines. As we said, cult isn't necessarily a negative term here in the Valley, but there are some winemakers and vintners who shy away from it because of what the expression has come to encompass. On the other end of the spectrum, consumers revel in the term, especially if they're able to access some of these cult wines. Regardless of your opinion, however, cult wineries exist and are very much a symbol of Napa Valley (though there are cult wineries around the world, too). Below are 10 cult wineries in Napa Valley you should know about, including a few rising stars quickly joining the cult ranks. Courtesy of Lithology Lithology 500 Meadowood Lane, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 963-6015 Lithology pays tribute to the study of Napa Valley's unique geographic history lending itself to the region's unmistakeable terroir. Most famed for their Cabernet Sauvignon sourced from their 13-acre vineyard under the Alejandro Bulgheroni Estate in St. Helena, Lithology also produces single vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc sourced from the highly sought after plots of Beckstoffer Dr. Crane, Beckstoffer Las Piedras, and Beckstoffer To Kalon. The Estate recently added a tiny block of Sauvignon Blanc that is sure to be a cult hit of its own in seasons to come. Courtesy of Screaming Eagle Screaming Eagle Oakville, (707) 944-0749 No list of cult wines would be complete without pointing to Screaming Eagle, a label that's considered to pioneer the category in the late 90s. Though cult status wasn't the intention of Jean Phillips, who founded the brand in 1986, the wine's notoriety has only compounded since its first 100 points by Robert Parker in 1997 (rating their very first vintage from 1992). The flagship Cabernet Sauvignon is traditionally blended with tiny amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc. You may find a stray bottle on the market selling in the range of thousands of dollars (their 2019 vintage starts at $3,899), however, the winery openly discourages resale from its exclusive members' list. Courtesy of Scarecrow Scarecrow Rutherford, (707) 963-3361 A minimalist label showcasing a household icon, Scarecrow pays homage to the original owner's ranch where its ultra-premium Cabernet Sauvignon grapes are grown\u2014JJ Cohn was Chief of Production at MGM during Hollywood's \u2018golden era' and played an essential role in the production of The Wizard of Oz. While Scarecrow recognizes the eponymous, loveable character it's also a symbol of prideful, American agriculture. The single-vineyard release sees no more than 2,000 cases bottled per vintage and is only available to mailing list members on a first-come, first-serve basis with no allocations. Courtesy of Harlan Estate Harlan Estate Oakville, (707) 944-1441 In 1984, Bill Harlan founded Harlan Estate with the goal to create First Growth California wines\u2014reminiscent of the best Grand Crus from Bordeaux. Now recognized as one of the original cult wineries in the Valley, the estate is known for its two top-tier labels, The Maiden, and its proprietary Red Blend, produced from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Petit Verdot grown on Harlan's 240 acres that rises in elevation from 225 to 1,225 feet above sea level. The varying elevation of the vineyards provide distinct terroir for these first growth wines which has undoubtedly contributed to the estate's global reputation. Courtesy of Promontory Promontory 1601 Oakville Grade, Oakville, CA 94562, (707) 944-0125 One of three wineries under Domain H. William Harlan (the others include the aforementioned Harlan Estate as well as BOND), Promontory made a name for itself as a relative newcomer to the Valley. The Harlan family acquired the 860-acre property in 2008, and have maintained its ruggedness\u2013a facet that makes both the wine so special and limited as less than 10% of the land is under vine. The first Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend to hit the market was in 2009 (though Promontory produced a 2008 vintage, the owners were not happy with the result and will not sell it). Promontory differs from many other cult wineries as it offers a tasting room (by appointment only) and allocation of wines. Courtesy of Component Wine Company Component Wine Company 270 Kreuzer Lane, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 332-2499 This boutique label was founded by Michael Kennedy, former sommelier and wine director for chef Eric Ripert's Blue at The Ritz-Carlton, Grand Cayman, with a mission to isolate specific parcels of vineyards from top sites throughout the Valley to hone in on the beauty of each single \u201ccomponent\u201d\u2014grapes that're typically thrown into a blend. Component's first wine from Napa was a 2013 Petit Verdot (only two barrels were produced). In 2014, they added Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc to their portfolio. Today, Component produces around 750 cases under the guidance of winemaker Marc Gagnon, the former assistant winemaker at Screaming Eagle and head winemaker at Bryant Family Vineyard, who joined the team in 2019. Bella Oaks, Courtesy of Matt Morris Photos Bella Oaks 1350 Bella Oaks Lane, Rutherford, CA 94573 In 2019\u2014Bella Oaks' latest release\u2014only 430 cases were produced of their proprietary, single-vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. The vineyard sits in the foothills of the Mayacamas Mountains, in what's known as the Rutherford Bench, and dates back to the mid-19th century. When Suzanne Deal Booth purchased the property in 2010, she enlisted some of the best in the industry to revitalize this historic plot and simultaneously emphasize biodynamic practices, including vineyard manager David Abreu, winemaker Nigel Kinsman, and master blender Michael Rolland. The estate achieved certified organic status in 2019, of which the same year's vintage received 100 points by Antonio Galloni of Vinous Media. Courtesy of Roy Estate Roy Estate 1220 Soda Canyon Road, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 968-1710 This 47-acre estate was purchased in 2017 by Stephan Cr\u00e9tier and his wife St\u00e9phany Maillery specifically for its world-class vineyard blocks of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Petit Verdot, which comprise their portfolio of wines today: Roy Estate Cabernet Sauvignon, Roy Estate Mr. Evans Proprietary Red, and only released in exceptional vintages, Roy Estate La R\u00eaveuse. Since then, Robert Parker, Jr. has described this Napa property as \u201ca hidden gem and top under-the-radar wine estate\u201d producing wines of elegance and length. Each vintage never exceeds 1,500 cases, but La R\u00eaveuse typically caps out at 50 cases or fewer. Courtesy of Vice Versa Vice Versa Wine 1461 Railroad Avenue STE 100, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 412-8423 Founded in 2003 by Montreal-native Patrice Breton, Vice Versa Wines are predominantly sold as futures directly to consumers per their mailing list. That means many of these wines are sold before they're even bottled, which is a nod to the label's success in the Valley. For the 2019 vintage, Vice Versa released 13 wines\u2014primarily Cabernet Sauvignon but two outliers included Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from Platt Vineyard\u2014totaling 3,020 cases. Aside from Platt and their own estate vineyard, Vice Versa sources grapes across vineyards recognized for their exclusivity and excellence, including; Beckstoffer To Kalon (the 2019 single vineyard expression recently received a second 100 points from The Wine Advocate), Beckstoffer Dr. Crane, Beckstoffer Las Piedras, Beckstoffer George III, and Steltzner. Courtesy of Realm Cellars Realm Cellars 5795 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 224-1910 Though the label dates back to 2002, it wasn't until 2012 that its modern resurrection began, when new owner Scott Becker took over and began reviving Realm from bankruptcy. The cellar now produces 15,000 cases across a portfolio of 12 wines of Bordeaux and Burgundy-dominant blends that they say are \u201cinspired by the classics but rooted in the future.\u201d The collection includes proprietary blends like their flagship Cabernet Sauvignon-forward The Bard, estate wines like Farella Cabernet Sauvignon, and single vineyard wines, sourced from the likes of Beckstoffer To Kalon and Beckstoffer Dr. Crane. At the beginning of 2022, Realm Cellars acquired Nine Suns and Houyi Vineyard in Pritchard Hill, one of Napa's most exclusive zip codes, which brings Realm's total acreage up to 200. \u2013 Most Beautiful Wineries in Napa \u2013 \u2013 Best Wineries for Napa Cabernet \u2013 Author Jillian Dara Jillian Dara is a freelance journalist focusing on wine, spirits, travel, and culture.

        "text": "Beautiful weather, bucolic landscapes, a plethora of outdoor activities, and some of the best food and wine to be had in the country makes Napa Valley a top summer vacation destination. Whether you're traveling with your partner, friends, or even the kids, California's premiere Wine Country has something for everyone. From wine tasting to outdoor excursions, and everything in between, here are the top 10 things to do on a summer getaway to Napa Valley. Make Time for Picnic Pleasures Courtesy of Bob McClenahan Nothing says summer like an old-fashioned picnic, and in Napa picnics go glam at tasting rooms around the region. Book the couples picnic at Clos Pegase for a lunch prepared to perfectly pair with the winery's reds and whites. Enjoy lunch in Rutherford Hills Winery 's scenic Oak Grove with a view of Napa Valley. Pack your own gourmet picnic and visit Napa Cellars for a pleasant afternoon in Wine Country, or head for the hills to the historic Pope Valley Winery to enjoy great views, a game of bocce, and a walk through the winery's 100-year-old hand dug wine cave. Savor the Sound of Music Courtesy of Unsplash During the summer months, the entire Napa Valley is alive with the sounds of music. One of the most popular outdoor live music venues is Oxbow River Stage , located in downtown Napa, with eight summer concerts from June to September and featuring acts like Robert Plant, A-ha, and Norah Jones. Combine wine and music with Blue Note Napa's summer jazz concert series at Charles Krug Winery . If you're in Napa in July, don't miss the Festival Napa Valley , a 10-day music and dance festival held at various locations throughout Napa. For theater fans, the Broadway & Vine series features four summer shows with a different Broadway star performing showtunes at each. Seek Out Summer Springs Courtesy of Dr. Wilkinson's Backyard Resort & Mineral Springs Since the 19th century people have traveled to Napa Valley for the mineral springs found in the area. Today, soak up the healing waters around Calistoga at the newly renovated Dr Wilkinson's Backyard Resort & Mineral Springs , where you can detox in a volcanic ash mud bath followed by a soak in the spring-fed mineral pools. Nearby, the five-star Spa at Solage also gives guests the opportunity to relax in its mineral pools, which range from 60 to 104 degrees, and add an infrared sauna and eucalyptus steam to the bathhouse ritual. Sip and Swirl Chimney Rock, Courtesy of Brooke Bartolomei The heart and soul of Napa is its wine culture, and no trip would be complete without wine tasting at some of the area's top wineries. At the state-of-the-art Chimney Rock winery, winemaker Elizabeth Vianna consistently puts out estate grown cabernet sauvignon that captures the essence of Napa in a glass. While Pine Ridge Vineyards is also known for its cabernet sauvignon, don't miss trying its unique chenin blanc/viognier blend when you visit the beautiful estate set in the hills of the Stag Leap AVA. Dating back to the late 1800s, Stags' Leap has developed a cult-like following for its petite sirah, which is featured in its Take the Leap tasting. Embark on Epicurean Adventures Courtesy of Lucy Restaurant Napa may be known for wine, but its food scene is a close second. Using only locally and regionally sourced ingredients, Lucy Restaurant at the Bardessono Resort & Spa in Yountville crafts a vegetable-forward seasonal menu. For a taste of France, head down the street to Thomas Keller's Michelin-starred Bouchon Bistro for classics like escargots paired with the restaurant's exclusive Vin de Carafe, house wine sourced from some of the finest winemakers in the area. For more French flair try Bistro Jeanty , also in Yountville, with its fantastic vegan take on Boeuf Bourguignon. Executive Chef Philip Tessier, whose resume includes positions at Michelin Three-star establishments The French Laundry, Per Se, and Le Bernardin, brings his kitchen chops to Press in St. Helena, where the menu highlights the very best of the region. For a one-stop shop for the flavors of Napa Valley, head to downtown Napa's Oxbow Public Market to enjoy restaurants like C Casa and Eiko's at Oxbow, or to pick up picnic supplies from Oxbow Cheese & Wine Merchant or Milestone Provisions. Soar in the Sky Sunrise ride with Napa Valley Balloons, Courtesy of Napa Valley Balloons There's no doubt about the fact that with its rolling hillsides and vineyards, Napa Valley is a beauty. One of the best ways to appreciate the landscape is floating above it in a hot air balloon. Join Napa Valley Balloons for a unique Balloon and eBike Tour, featuring a morning soar followed by an eBike tour to different wineries. Or, venture on a group balloon ride with a post-flight Champagne breakfast with Napa Valley Aloft . Experience The Great Outdoors Courtesy of Unsplash In the heart of Napa, Bothe-Napa Valley State Park offers hiking trails that allow visitors to meander through coastal redwoods and forests of Douglas fir, madrone, and tanoak trees. After the walk, cool off in the park's swimming pool. The Sugarloaf Ridge State Park is full of delights, from a nature trail that runs along Sonoma Creek to the chance to see San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and the Sierra Nevada Mountains from the summit of Bald Mountain. The Robert Ferguson Observatory is in the park, with three telescopes for public viewing. See New Sights Old Faithful Geyser, Courtesy of Calistoga Chamber of Commerce Step back 3 million years at Calistoga's Petrified Forest . This ancient forest was created after a volcanic explosion knocked down the redwoods that stood in its path. Today visitors can hike one of two trails to get an up close view of this unique natural landmark. Mother Nature is also on display at California's Old Faithful Geyser . One of three geysers in the world with this name, this powerful Calistoga geyser erupts every 15 to 30 minutes and when it does it often leaves a beautiful rainbow perfect for your Instagram shot. Drive or bike Napa's most iconic wine road, The Silverado Trail . This two-lane highway was built in 1852 and lets visitors meander through Wine Country at a more leisurely pace than Highway 29. The 30-mile trail winds through hills and rolling vineyards, offering a different slice of Napa Valley. Since 1972, The Napa Valley Museum has documented the local history of Napa, showcased local and regional artists, and brought world-class art exhibitions to Yountville. Explore the Region on Two Wheels Courtesy of Bob McClenahan One of the best ways to explore Napa Valley is by bicycle. Bike through beautiful north Napa on a Calistoga Cycling and Wine Tasting Tour , visiting two wineries during the 12-mile, mostly flat ride. The guided experience includes use of a hybrid bike and helmet, unlimited water, and a Wine Country picnic lunch, with stops for wine along the way. And further south, grab your bikes to ride along the beautiful Napa Valley Vine Trail , featuring 12.5 continuous miles of trail from South Napa to Yountville, with many more miles to come. Make a Splash Courtesy of Bob McClenahan When the mercury rises one of the best ways to cool down is at Lake Berryessa, the largest lake in Napa and one of the largest fresh water lakes in California. Kayak, paddle board, jet ski, or simply jump in the water. With little crowds and calm waters, the Napa River provides the perfect setting for paddleboarders, and Napa Valley Paddle is the go-to for SUP rentals. Enjoy the tranquility of paddling by forests, tidal wetlands, and mountains. Along the way, river otters, turtles, and birds might be your only companions. If you want to float down the river with less effort, book a Napa Valley Gondola cruise. Choose The Sandolo tour and bring your own wine and cheese, or opt for the private couples Wine Tasting Tour where you'll have a wine tasting from Cadle Family Wines as you float down the river. Both experiences feature Italian serenades from your gondolier. Blessed with beautiful landscapes, warm weather, welcoming tasting rooms, fantastic food, and a host of outdoor adventures to be had, Napa Valley is a slam dunk for a summer getaway. \u2013 The Best Time of Year to Visit Napa Valley \u2013 \u2013 Must-Stay Hotels in Napa Valley \u2013 Author Dena Roche Dena Roch\u00e9 is a freelance wine and travel journalist who has visited over 35 wine regions of the world.

        "title": "The Top 8 Things to Do in Yountville",
        "text": "Yountville , a tiny 1.5-square mile town less than 10 miles north of the town Napa, is credited with being home to the first grapevines in all of Napa Valley. Today, the ritzy enclave is also known for its small-town charm, abundance of world-class restaurants (including the famous Three-Michelin-starred The French Laundry), dedication to the arts, stylish hotels, natural beauty, stunning architecture, boutique wineries, and walkability. The latter actually makes it one of the most appealing destinations in all of Napa Valley, as once you park your car upon arrival, there's almost no reason to touch your car keys until it's time to return home. Read on to discover some of the most indulgent, exciting, and relaxing ways to enjoy yourself while on a getaway to this charming town that bills itself as the Heart of Napa Valley. Soar Above in a Hot Air Balloon See Napa from a new perspective while soaring about the vineyards in a hot air balloon. Napa Valley Aloft has been flying above Yountville's gorgeous landscape since 1978, with baskets that hold 8 to 12 passengers and an option for a post-flight brunch with mimosas. (You can also book a private balloon for special occasions.) Napa Valley Balloons is another acclaimed company for taking in the sights of the region from above and has baskets that carry 6, 12, 16, and 20 passengers, with private flights for two. Courtesy of Napa Valley Balloons Whichever company you choose for your adventure, you'll arrive before dawn to watch the colorful balloons get inflated and then take off soon after sunrise when the winds are calm, and the temps are cool. As you rise into the sky, you'll take in views of the Napa Valley floor, Mt. St. Helena, Mayacamas Mountain Range, and on days when the wind cooperates, glimpses of the San Francisco skyline and the Sierras. Dine on Locally-Sourced Food at Top Restaurants Northern California is known for its amazing bounty of fresh ingredients grown and raised by local farmers, and you'll find ample opportunity to enjoy that farm-to-table dining perfection at several Yountville restaurants. Lucy Restaurant & Bar is located inside the sleek and luxurious Bardessono Hotel & Spa. This stylish and earthy spot is a great place to enjoy a superb meal of refined but approachable food made with produce grown in the estate's California Certified Organic Farming garden, as well as locally and regionally sourced ingredients. The focus is first and foremost on the vegetable dishes, many of which are elevated takes on classics and prepared in such a way that the ingredients are consistently the star. Food at Lucy Restaurant, Courtesy of Bardessono Hotel & Spa Enjoy Italian fine dining in Napa at Bottega Napa Valley , a lively restaurant from celebrity chef Michael Chiarello, where all of the dishes highlight local, seasonal ingredients and bold flavors. The menu reads like a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d of Italian favorites (though it changes based on the availability of ingredients), so there's truly something for all carb lovers, including a daily risotto with seasonal accompaniments. The French Laundry is on almost everyone's Napa fine dining bucket list for good reason. Their multi-course dinner is a treat for the senses, but for those looking for a truly unique dining experience highlighting local ingredients, the trick is to order the restaurant's \u201cTasting of Vegetables\u201d menu. The French Laundry has a \u201cculinary gardener\u201d on staff whose job is to tend to the 3.5-acre garden across the street from the restaurant, which serves as their main source of produce, as well as to collaborate with the chefs before harvesting the day's bounty for that evening's meal. Take a Leisurely Stroll to Wine Taste One of the best things about Yountville is that you can enjoy everything the town offers without ever getting in a car, including one of the best things the town has to offer: over a dozen stroll-able winery tasting rooms. At the Priest Ranch tasting room, you can try cabernet sauvignon and sauvignon blanc, as well as several less common varietals, including grenache blanc and a Brut ros\u00e9 of syrah. And while you can pair your tasting with a specialty cheese and charcuterie board, the Bacon & Wine Experience is the way to go\u2026 because what other winery tasting room is going to offer you a pairing of four distinctly flavored types of bacon to pair with your wines? Handwritten Wines, Courtesy of Handwritten Wines | Joel Quigley Just a few steps from Priest Ranch is Handwritten Wines , a contemporary space with indoor and outdoor seating where you can sample the winery's proprietary Bordeaux-style blend \u201cThree Worlds,\u201d its Santa Rita Hills Pinot Noir from Santa Barbara County, as well as sauvignon blanc and chardonnay. If you're especially fond of pinot noir, the Pinot Noir Vertical Experience is a must; you'll explore the different growing seasons and aging nuances while sipping four vintages from the same vineyard. Jessup Cellars, Courtesy of Jessup Cellars It will take you about 10 minutes to walk from Handwritten Wines to Jessup Cellars , known to be one of the friendliest tasting rooms in Wine Country, where the art-covered gallery walls provide the perfect setting for enjoying premium wines fit for aficionados and novices alike. If you began the day with the bacon pairing at Priest Ranch, it only makes sense to end it with Jessup Cellars' Chocolate Lovers Experience, which comes with six local chocolates that can be mixed and matched with a curated selection of wines. Discover Regional Art at the Napa Valley Museum Take a break from wining and dining to learn a little more about the place from where it all comes. Hop on the free Yountville Trolley (downtown) to the Napa Valley Museum to explore three galleries of West Coast art, a showcase of noteworthy aspects of local culture, and selections that exemplify the region's history. Courtesy of Napa Valley Museum Hang Poolside at a Stylish Hotel For a Wine Country getaway to be truly relaxing, it must involve taking a break from wine tasting to sit poolside with a drink (or book) in hand. At Bardessono , hotel guests can do this at the 75-foot-long rooftop pool, which offers poolside cabanas, chaise lounges, and food and drink service. You'll see nothing but blue skies at Bardessono's pool, but if you prefer your pool experience with a side of towering cypress trees, you'll find just that at Hotel Yountville . The pool area also has daybeds that can be rented ahead of time, as well as an in-ground whirlpool spa, fire pit, and food and drink service. Courtesy of Hotel Yountville Walk the Walk\u2014the Art Walk, That Is Discover 35 outdoor sculptures (most of which are available for purchase to benefit the Yountville Arts fund) within a mile or so of each other on the Yountville Art Walk . Roam around and see what you find (you can learn more about each piece by scanning the QR code on the plaque), or download the printable map to ensure you see them all. Courtesy of the Yountville Chamber of Commerce Play a Round of Golf Whether you hit the links often or just enjoy a leisurely afternoon on the greens, check out Vintner's Golf Club . The championship nine-hole resort course features three different sets of tees, and is an excellent option for an afternoon of golf as it's welcoming to all levels. Stop by the Lakeside Grill after a round for a club sandwich and beer (or wine) in a picturesque setting. Courtesy of Unsplash Sip Your Way Through Nearby Wineries It wouldn't be a trip to Yountville without exploring some of the town's outstanding boutique wineries. Fans of rock n' roll will definitely appreciate Cliff Lede Vineyards , where the vineyard's \u201cRock Blocks\u201d are named after songs and albums, like \u201cDark Side of the Moon\u201d and \u201cLight My Fire.\u201d The outdoor patio is gorgeous, but for a truly unique experience, opt for the Backstage Tasting Lounge, where you can sip while enjoying rotating art exhibits. Cliff Lede's Backstage Tasting Lounge, Courtesy of Bob McClenahan At Goosecross Cellars , a winery that is close to downtown but feels off the beaten path, you'll take in views of the vineyards, Yountville Hills, and the Mayacamas Mountain Range while enjoying a diverse portfolio of meticulously crafted wines of all varietals, including sauvignon blanc, cabernet, chardonnay, viognier, and syrah. Mira Winery, Courtesy of Mira Winery Mira Winery is also worth a visit, especially for those who enjoy all-natural and/or single-vineyard wines. This Napa Valley winery's serene estate is the only place in the Western Hemisphere where you'll be able to see Ovum, the world's first egg-shaped barrel crafted from oak that produces only two barrels a year. \u2013 Best Hotels in Yountville \u2013 \u2013 Best Wineries to Visit in Yountville \u2013 Author Daisy Barringer Daisy Barringer is a freelance writer who grew up in San Francisco and now lives there with her 150-pound Saint Bernard, Monkey.

        "title": "7 Unexpected Ways to Experience Tamber Bey Vineyards",
        "text": "Tamber Bey Vineyards in Calistoga is one of Napa Valley \u2018s most unusual wineries in that it is located in the middle of a working horse ranch. In fact, the 15,000-square-foot winery was once a covered riding arena. Tamber Bey's primary purpose is winemaking, but it is also a working horse ranch home to over 20 horses. What else would you expect from a vintner, Barry Waitte, who is so passionate about horses that he named his winery after his first two Arabian horses, Tamborina and Bayamo? Courtesy of Sarah Risk A visit to this magnificent property is truly like nothing else you'll find in Napa. Here are seven unique ways to experience it all, from eating and drinking to playing and exploring. (Just be sure to plan ahead as tours and tastings are by appointment only.) Mingle with horses Not many Napa Valley wineries encourage you to horse around, but that's exactly what happens at Tamber Bey, which is located at Sundance Ranch, a world-class equestrian facility where high-performance Arabian horses are trained, and abused and neglected horses are cared for and given sanctuary. There are 20 horses on the property at all times, and there are always a few hanging out who are happy to say hi and pose for a photo. The Private Retrospective Tasting includes a tour with your tasting is the best way to meet some of the resident horses, as well as see the ranch and the crush and barrel facility. Courtesy of Sarah Risk See how well you toss horseshoes There are plenty of wineries in Calistoga with bocce courts, but it makes sense for a working horse ranch to have a horseshoe pit. It's not the, ahem, mane attraction, but it is regulation-standard and the perfect place to enjoy a little friendly (we hope!) competition while wine tasting. Bring your dog to join in on the fun Do you have a friendly, well-behaved dog who will happily stay on a six-foot leash? If so, you can bring him along on your Napa Valley wine tasting adventure. The folks at Tamber Bey will even give him treats and make sure he has plenty of water, because humans aren't the only ones who should make sure to hydrate when visiting a winery. Courtesy of Sarah Risk Enjoy a picnic lunch in the courtyard In theory, wine tasting and picnics go hand-in-hand, but in actuality, there are a lot of tasting rooms that don't offer food. Luckily, Tamber Bey makes it easy to fuel up in between sips. Regardless of which tasting experience you go for, you can pre-order a boxed picnic lunch from Sam's General Store in Calistoga, which includes a gourmet sandwich or salad, chips, and a cookie, plus a glass of wine. You'll enjoy your lunch on the picnic tables in the courtyard, which is surrounded by a 16-stall barn, with views of Mount St. Helena and the Palisades. Drink amazing wine Every wine on Tamber Bey's tasting menus has received a score of 90 points or higher. The grapes for these wines come from one of two estate-owned vineyards in Napa Valley plus vineyards in Sonoma and Lake Counties. You'll get a sampling of these top-rated wines during the Courtyard Tasting, the Savory Pairing Experience, and the Private Retrospective Tasting, so you can't go wrong. Courtesy of Sarah Risk Eat cookies Forget wine and cheese, at Tamber Bey it's all about wine and cookies. Seriously! The winery partnered with a local baker to create a collection of savory cookies that pair perfectly with its wines. With names like Wasabi Ginger, Black Bacon, Cardamom Crunch, and Lemon Loop, you know you're in for a tasting treat full of unexpected flavors. Plus, there's no other pairing like it in Napa Valley. Go big with the full Savory Pairing and Winemaking Tour Experience, or ask to add a savory cookie pairing to the Courtyard or Retrospective Tastings. Courtesy of Sarah Risk Enjoy wine by the glass post-tasting The atmosphere at Tamber Bey is so relaxing that there's a good chance you will want to linger a little longer, and everyone knows that lingering is made so much better when accompanied by wine, which Tamber Bey offers by the glass as an add-on after a tasting. But at that point, you might as well have pre-arranged for the picnic lunch since it includes a glass of wine, as already mentioned. Nothing compares to sipping and eating al fresco in the sunshine with views of horses and mountains in the distance, so why rush off? Open daily from 10am to 5pm. Tours and tastings by appointment only.

        "title": "Guide to a Weekend in Calistoga",
        "text": "Travelers looking for a relaxing vacation in Wine Country should pay attention to the small town of Calistoga . Visitors to Napa Valley's most northern city can mingle with farmers, grape growers, winemakers, and locals just by walking down the street or stopping by one of the many restaurants or tasting rooms the town has to offer. Sipping wine and relaxing by a geothermal mineral pool are the main attractions, but charming Calistoga has much more to offer. Staying in Calistoga Calistoga hotels focus on relaxation. Many boast heated mineral pools warmed from the rich mineral water that runs below the town and on-site spa offerings for ultimate rejuvenation without leaving the property. Courtesy of Dr. Wilkinson's Dr. Wilkinson's Backyard Resort and Mineral Springs 1507 Lincoln Avenue, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-6258 The recently renovated Dr. Wilkinson's perfectly blends nostalgic charm with a hip vibe and modern amenities.

The Inn on Pine, Courtesy of Booking.com The Inn on Pine 1202 Pine Street, Calistoga, California 94515, (707) 942-6829 The Inn on Pine is surrounded by vineyards but is only a few minutes walk to downtown Calistoga. It offers 13 rooms outfitted with Wine Country inspired decor and plush beds, alongside in-room fireplaces and soaking tubs. With a day spa on property, The Inn on Pine is a great place to detox with a mud wrap, made with local volcanic ash and clay, LED therapy, or a visit to their infrared sauna. Brunch in Calistoga Calistoga brunch is a must for visitors looking to go wine tasting in the afternoon. Many restaurants are open for brunch on weekdays, as well as weekends. Courtesy of Solage Solbar 755 Silverado Trail N., Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 226-0800 Solbar is a Michelin-recognized hotel restaurant and bar that is trendy yet approachable. Guests are treated to farm-fresh, seasonal ingredients, from breakfast to late-night lounge snacks. While the interior of the restaurant is beautifully designed, it's hard to beat starting your day with an al fresco meal on the expansive patio. At night, it's also the place to be to enjoy the 20-foot long fire pit. Courtesy of Cafe Sarafornia Cafe Sarafornia 1413 Lincoln Avenue, Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 942-0555 Cafe Sarafornia serves a traditional diner breakfast with a Wine Country twist. Seasonal dishes such as the Brannan Benedict \u2014 two poached eggs, avocado, bacon, and their very own gravy sauce on an English muffin \u2014 grace the menu, and portions are big, so bring your appetite. Courtesy of Facebook: Lovina Lovina 1107 Cedar Street, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-6500 Lovina, formerly known as the Calistoga Kitchen, underwent a revamp with a little help from San Francisco-based restaurateur, Jennifer Bennett, of Zazie fame. The sign \u201cGreat Food\u201d outside the small patio isn't just good marketing, it is a promise to guests to expect delicious eats when visiting. Open for brunch and dinner, dig in to their famed breakfast burrito on the new patio, and if you happen to stop by on a Wednesday night, enjoy 50% off bottles of wine and no corkage fees. Lunchtime in Calistoga If you are planning early morning or evening adventures in Calistoga, there are no shortage of places to grab a bite to eat midday. Courtesy of Calistoga Inn Calistoga Inn Restaurant & Brewery 1250 Lincoln Avenue, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-4101 The Calistoga Inn Restaurant & Brewery is for travelers who are looking for a casual lunch and a place to grab a beer (refreshing after a day of wine tasting). The outdoor patio with fire pits stretches along the Napa River and all the beer is made in the historic water tower. Courtesy of Facebook: Sam's Social Club Sam's Social Club 1712 Lincoln Avenue, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-4913 Sam's Social Club is a favorite stop for brunch, lunch, and dinner in the Calistoga restaurant scene, known for its thoughtfully composed seasonal comfort foods. Stop by between wine tastings to try their French Dip sandwich with shaved prime rib and horseradish cream. Dinner in Calistoga After a day of exploring northern Napa Valley, it's time to kick back, relax, and savor the many amazing flavors of the region. Courtesy of Evangeline Evangeline 1226 Washington Street, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 341-3131 Evangeline is casual French fare with a Creole twist. Tables are mostly patio seating, so make sure to bring layers when dining here. But it's worth it to enjoy an al fresco evening sipping an Old Fashioned and noshing on fried pickles, steak frites, and gumbo. Courtesy of Facebook: Amaro Italian Kitchen Amaro Italian Kitchen 1457 Lincoln Avenue, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-5938 Amaro is the Italian word for bitter, but \u2018pleasant' is a better word to describe this charming Italian eatery, located in the Mount View Hotel.

Travelers from all over the world visit here to experience the mineral pools, natural landscapes, hot air balloon rides, and bountiful Wine Country shopping. Safari West, Courtesy of Cheryl Crowley Plan to visit Safari West , a 400-acre wildlife sanctuary outside of Calistoga. Where else can you find giraffes, antelope, and lemurs in Wine Country? They also offer glamping, for a more comprehensive outdoorsy experience. Also worth checking out is the Old Faithful Geyser of California, located just north of downtown Calistoga. Get up close and personal as the geyser erupts every 20 to 30 minutes. Downtown has many local shops with unique gifts.

        "title": "10 Napa Valley Tasting Rooms Open After 5 p.m.",
        "text": "One might think that it would be easy to taste wine in Napa Valley at almost all hours of the day, but while there are lots of bars and restaurants that offer excellent wines by the glass and bottle, \u201clast call\u201d for tours and wine tastings at most Napa wineries is well before the sun sets over the vineyards. Still, if you're not much of a daytime drinker or are looking to keep tasting Napa Valley wines into the late afternoon/early evening, there are a few excellent wineries and tasting rooms where you can snag a reservation (or even walk in) until at least 6 p.m., including a couple that are open until midnight. Peju Winery Courtesy of Peju Winery | Katie Gallogly If you want to taste most of this small, family-owned winery's estate-grown wines, including the popular cabernet franc, you have to either join their wine club or visit the winery's tasting room. The latter sits inside one of the more recognizable buildings in Napa Valley, a copper-roofed, stone-faced building with a 50-foot tower at the end of a Sycamore tree-lined driveway and surrounded by gorgeous gardens with meandering walkways and outdoor sculptures. (Be sure to make time for a self-guided tour.) Reservations are required for all wine tastings, which are seated, with the last one offered at 5 p.m. 8466 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 963-3600 JaM Cellars Courtesy of JaM Cellars Imagine your quintessential Napa Valley tasting room. Now imagine the exact opposite. That's JaM Cellars, a \u201cwine and music studio\u201d with a living room vibe complete with Persian rugs, tables shaped like guitar picks, cozy seating including a couple of booths, and live music on Thursday from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. and Friday and Saturday from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. When there's not a band on the tiny stage, vinyl plays on the state-of-the-art sound system, making it very easy to sit back and relax with a glass, flight, or bottle of the very approachable JaM Cellars wine. JaM Cellars is open Sunday \u2013 Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 10 pm. And Thursday \u2013 Saturday from 10 a.m. to midnight. 1460 1st St, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 265-7577 Louis M. Martini Courtesy of Louis M. Martini This historic St. Helena winery is best known for being one of the first wineries to open in Napa Valley after Prohibition and has built a reputation around its world-class cabernet sauvignon. The recently-renovated historic winery has large glass walls that let in tons of natural light from outside, as well as one behind the Crown Bar in the main tasting room that offers wine tasters a view into the expansive oak barrel room. Louis M. Martini offers tours, an underground cellar experience, and cabana tastings, but that aforementioned bar is where guests who want to taste wine in the late afternoon will be. The winery is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., seven days a week, and reservations are required with the last one at 5 p.m. 254 St. Helena Highway S, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 968-3362 Domaine Carneros Courtesy of Domaine Carneros | Aubrey Anzelmo There is nothing quite like sitting on the terrace of the Ch\u00e2teau at Domaine Carneros while sipping sparkling wine and looking out at the vine-covered vineyard hills of Napa Valley's Carneros AVA. It is truly an idyllic Napa Valley experience, especially when paired with caviar, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, and potato chips. Reservations (available from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.) are required, and the last pour is at 5:30 p.m. Be sure to give yourself time to tour the beautiful formal gardens as they are truly spectacular. 1240 Duhig Road, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 257-0101 Priest Ranch Winery Courtesy of Priest Ranch Winery This Napa Valley winery is known for adventurous yet approachable wine made with minimal intervention. The tasting room is located in the heart of Yountville and features a large oak table and floors made with wood from the ranch, as well as a glass, temperature-controlled wine fridge that holds over 1,000 bottles. Walk-ins are welcome, and reservations are available until 6 p.m. (although if you want to explore something unique and pair your wines with bacon, the last reservation for that guest experience is 4:30 p.m.). 6490 Washington Street, Yountville, CA 94599, (707) 944-8200 Rutherford Hill Winery Credit: Rutherford Hill Winery Rutherford is known as one of Napa Valley's finest AVAs and produces exquisite cabernet sauvignons.

It's offered on Thursday and Friday nights, and there is only one booking, so you'll truly have the Napa Valley estate to yourself. 1160 Oak Knoll Avenue, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 255-7700 John Anthony Vineyards Courtesy of John Anthony Vineyards It's somewhat difficult to find a place to taste wine after dinner in Wine Country, but at John Anthony Vineyards' tasting lounge in the heart of downtown Napa, you can enjoy late night tastings.

        "title": "Top 7 Winery Tours in Calistoga",
        "text": "Calistoga is known for wellness and wineries, a perfect pairing if ever there was one. The quaint town in Napa Valley boasts hot springs, mud baths, and some of the best wineries in Napa. Here we explore six Calistoga wineries and a bike tour that rise to the top with the wine tasting and tour experiences they offer guests. From wine tours through caves to a tour on two wheels, here are the top winery tours in Calistoga to seek out. Tamber Bay Courtesy of Tamber Bey | Sarah Risk Pony on over to Tamber Bay, a family-run winery and ranch just a few minutes from downtown Calistoga that combines great wines and spectacular horses. The name is a nod to owner Barry Waitte's first two Arabian horses, Tamborina and Bayamo. Today the winemaking facility is a converted covered riding arena, and the ranch is home to more than 20 horses. During any visit guests have the chance to sip great wine and mingle with the horses. Oenophiles should opt for the Private Retrospective Tasting . Available for groups of two to 20 people, the tasting features current releases alongside library wines, as well as a look inside the vineyard's wine production and horse operations. Guests can also add on a picnic lunch to enjoy more of the bucolic grounds. 1251 Tubbs Lane, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-2100 Brian Arden Wines Courtesy of Brian Arden Great wine and great food are a classic pairing, and the new Chef Experience Tasting at Brian Arden does it perfectly. As soon as you arrive, you'll be welcomed with a glass to sip on your guided tour of the gardens, vineyards, and winemaking facilities. The tour ends with a food-paired tasting either in the open chef's kitchen or the wrap-around patio. Come hungry because Executive Chef Spencer Conaty, who worked at Morimoto and Silver Oak Winery before joining Brian Arden, has a feast planned. Expect to taste epic hand-crafted cabernet sauvignon and other Bordeaux varietals alongside the food. 331 Silverado Trail, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-4767 Storybook Mountain Vineyards Courtesy of Facebook: Storybook Mountain Vineyards With a property originally owned by the Brothers Grimm in the late 1800s, and a fairytale setting, it's no surprise that Jerry and Sigrid Seps renamed the estate Storybook Mountain Vineyards when they purchased the 90-acre property in 1976. Today the family-run vineyard is known for its luscious zinfandels as well as cabernet sauvignon, red Bordeaux varietals, and viognier. Plan to book the Vineyard, Cave, and Redwood Grove experience where you'll enjoy a guided tour of the organically farmed vineyards, explore the three caves, and then cap it off with a tasting in the beautiful redwood grove. 3835 CA-128, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-5310 Getaway Adventures Bike Tours Courtesy of Getaway Adventures If you're looking to burn calories as you sip, and take in some of Calistoga's top wineries, join Getaway Adventures' Sip \u2018n Cycle tour .

Meets in Logvy Community Park: 1401 N Oak Street, Calistoga, CA 94515 Davis Estates Courtesy of Facebook: Davis Estates Davis Estates is the perfect midday stop during a day of wine tasting, particularly for their cave tour and tasting. In 2011 the Davis family purchased the century-old estate and did a massive renovation, including building an 11,000-square-foot cave. The caves not only store wine, they also offer spaces for tasting and serve as an art gallery to display the large art collection owners Mike and Sandy Davis have accumulated over the years. After a tour of the impressive caves you'll be given a private space in the tasting room. Ask for the outdoor terrace when booking to sit on the large swinging sofas to enjoy not only the food and wine, but also the beautiful Calistoga landscape. You'll taste through a flight of the vineyard's current releases, perfectly paired with seasonal bites created by Executive Chef Mark Caldwell. 4060 Silverado Trail, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-0700 Clos Pegase Courtesy of Clos Pegase Renowned wines and great design come together at Clos Pegase, a winery designed by acclaimed architect Michael Graves.

The winery, housed in a beautiful Victorian mansion, dates to the 19th century and got its second wind in the 1960s when it was restored by the Davies family. Schramsberg wines have been served at official state functions by every president since Richard Nixon. Choose the Cave Tour and Sparkling Wine tasting to sample five limited varieties of Schramsberg bubbles, along with a peek into the expansive cave system \u2013 among the largest caves in Napa Valley. If you are visiting in spring or fall and want a deep dive into the world of wine, then consider attending Camp Schramsberg. Summer camp was never like this, with a hands-on, behind-the-scenes look at the making of sparkling wine during a three-day immersive experience. 1400 Schramsberg Road, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-4558 A trip to Napa Valley's Wine Country is a must for any wine lover. Whether you opt for a cave tour to learn more about the terroir, varietals, and winemaking process of your favorite Calistoga wines, or turn your tasting into more of an adventure with a cycling tour, these Calistoga winery tours have everything needed for a memorable day in Northern Napa Valley. \u2013 9 Napa Valley Wine Tours for Every Type of Traveler \u2013 \u2013 15 Best Wineries in Calistoga \u2013 Author Dena Roche Dena Roch\u00e9 is a freelance wine and travel journalist who has visited over 35 wine regions of the world.

        "text": "This experience is now taking bookings for 2022, visit website for details! There's no shortage of world-class gastronomy in Napa Valley , but an exciting culinary offering from The CIA at Copia takes the seriousness and pretension out of fine dining. Le Petit Chef\u2122 is a one-of-a-kind, 3D dining experience inspired by Marco Polo's legendary travels along the Silk Road \u2014 and it's unlike any dinner you'll have in Wine Country, let alone the entire West Coast of America. From an inspiring, multicultural menu to the use of highly innovative technology, here are 10 reasons why your inner foodie won't want to miss it. It's like history class, but way, way more fun If you associate Marco Polo more with the popular swimming pool game than his actual place in history, you're likely not alone. The good news: this educational experience isn't like any history class you've ever taken. Le Petit Chef is an immersive, entertaining dining event that utilizes cutting-edge technology \u2014 plus delicious, flavor-packed food \u2014 to teach you all about Marco Polo and his incredible travels along the Great Silk Road, known as a system of trade routes that ran between the Mediterranean and China. But more than that, Le Petit Chef is a lesson in the diversity of cultures. At the time (the 1200s), Polo went further than anyone had gone before. He was an inspiration to future great explorers like Henry the Navigator and Columbus, and his story, as told through Le Petit Chef, will no doubt inspire others to get out and see the world, too. The dinner adventure is led by the best tour guide ever This isn't your boring double decker bus tour. A tiny and very funny Frenchman named Le Petit Chef \u2014 who sounds like a Minion or Alvin of Alvin and the Chipmunks \u2014 is a five-star tour guide, bravely following in Marco Polo's footsteps by sailing stormy seas, flying away from hungry camels, and barely escaping death by fire-breathing dragon, all while his passengers laugh along every step of the way. You get to eat around the world Go to any fine dining or Michelin-starred restaurant and, while you may get to indulge in multiple courses of food, they will likely all be focused on a single cuisine. But during Le Petit Chef, each course is inspired by a different country that Marco Polo visited along his travels. While Polo's real journey took 24 years, this two-hour exploration takes each food lover overseas to discover the cuisine of southern France, the eastern Mediterranean and North Africa, the Indian subcontinent, the Himalayas, and China. And you'll sip on the best of California It wouldn't be a proper Napa Valley dinner without wine and Le Petit Chef has the option of adding a wine pairing to each course. The menu showcases a range of varietals \u2014 like riesling and pinot noir \u2014 from California, thoughtfully selected to showcase the quality and breadth of California's top growing regions. Not a wine fan or want to switch it up? You can also find a great selection of beer to go with the food. Speaking of the menu, it's fantastic An amuse-bouche trio of a melt-in-your-mouth Nicosia Tartelette, a Saffron Vichyssoise, and Beau Soleil Oysters with a charred cucumber mignonette set the stage for six memorable courses. Experience traditional dishes from each country, like the delightful lamb meatball and hummus Sabich Bowl from North Africa, and the umami-packed Shorb Rib Bao with black pepper jus and picked mushrooms from China. For the finale, inspiration from all of the travels comes together to create a fabulous dessert. It's The Culinary Institute of America, so of course they cook to impress. The technology is so impressive, Steve Jobs would have approved Le Petit Chef offers a cutting-edge restaurant experience, which comes to life via state-of-the-art 3D technology and visual storytelling by the world-renowned artists of Skullmapping\u2122 and TableMation\u2122. What this means is that Marco Polo's travels are literally brought to life using incredibly vivid animation that washes across the walls and tables of the dining room, transporting guests across the world and firing up all of their senses at once. It's as close as one can get to feeling the hot sands of the Arabian desert between their toes or smelling the multi-colored spices of India without actually being there. There's audience participation Don't worry, this isn't like a Disney attraction where random people are brought up on stage as stunt doubles in front of a crowd of people. Le Petit Chef simply introduces several immersive opportunities for diners to do more than just chow down on the food. Without giving anything away, they implement tools to encourage discussions and reflection on the experience as it's happening \u2014 plus there's one big surprise that's guaranteed to have everyone \u201cOohing\u201d and \u201cAhhing\u201d. Tip: Have the video setting on your phone ready when you reach Himalaya. It's a great family activity (with older kids) This experience is not recommended for children under 12, but young adults and budding foodies will definitely get a kick out of the dinner, so long as they're not terribly picky eaters. [Note: Le Petit Chef cannot accommodate all dietary restrictions or special requests]. It's sure to introduce them to parts of the world they've likely never traveled to and leave them with a thirst for adventure. Le Petit Chef is one of a kind There are a lot of amazing dining options to choose from throughout Napa Valley but none of them are anything like this, combining fantastic food with wonderful entertainment and innovative technology. But even if you've experienced this dining phenomenon already, you may want to make a reservation again, as Le Petit Chef will be debuting a new movie this summer that will surely entertain like never before. You can plan a whole day of activities around it The CIA at Copia is centrally located in downtown Napa's buzzing Oxbow district, so you may as well head down earlier in the day to explore everything the area has to offer, from the Oxbow Public Market to wine tasting rooms, breweries, and gourmet restaurants. You could even spend the better part of the day right at The CIA at Copia. Book a hands-on cooking class in their stadium-sized teaching kitchen and explore the Chuck Williams Culinary Arts Museum (free to the public). Or plan to shop the expertly curated collection of goods for the home and kitchen at the Marketplace at COPIA , then grab a glass of one of the 24 wines on offer at the self-serve wine bar before your 3D dining adventure begins. If you choose to stay the night, the Westin Verasa Napa and the chic Andaz Napa are both a short walk away, making for a restful way to end a night of indulging your foodie dreams. Le Petit Chef is available by reservation Friday and Saturday nights at 6 PM. Cost is $155 per person (pre-paid) with $50 addition for the optional beverage pairing.

        "title": "The 10 Best Wine & Food Pairings at Napa Valley Wineries",
        "text": "Gone are the days when the only food you could procure at a Napa Valley winery was breadsticks, maybe a cheese plate, and if you were really lucky, a gourmet picnic lunch. Today, more and more Napa wineries are leaning into the idea that wine is best enjoyed with food. In fact, many wineries are hiring talented chefs to work directly with the winemakers to create food menus that pair perfectly with the wines while showcasing the region's seasonal bounty \u2013 much of which is often grown on the Wine Country estates and is just as, if not even more, delicious than any meal one would get dining at a restaurant. It's a chance for visitors to elevate the typical wine tasting experience while relaxing with a fantastic meal and learning more about the wine than they ever would standing at a tasting room. Read on to learn about ten Napa Valley wineries that are offering exceptional wine and culinary journeys of all kinds. Trefethen Family Vineyards Courtesy of Trefethen Family Vineyards It's nearly impossible not to work up an appetite during the drive down the very long driveway that leads to this family-owned Napa winery established in 1968, so it's perfect that there are three dining experiences from which to choose. Taste the Estate is the \u201cquintessential wine and culinary experience,\u201d with five wines paired with bites that showcase \u201cthe interplay of the flavors and textures of wine and food.\u201d Twilight at Trefethen takes place in the evening (a rarity in Napa Valley) and includes a short tour followed by a wine tasting and seasonal shared plates. Lastly, there's the Legacy Tasting hosted by a certified sommelier. It begins with a tour of the winery, gardens, and Villa, followed by tastings of Legacy Collection wines paired with a hearty lunch. 1160 Oak Knoll Ave, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 255-7700 Round Pond Estate Courtesy of Round Pond Estate Located in the prestigious Rutherford AVA in Napa Valley, Round Pond is known for its high-end cabernet sauvignon, gorgeous estate with views of the Mayacamas Mountains, and olive oil production. During the Il Pranzo food and wine tasting experience, guests go on a culinary journey that begins with a tour of the winery garden and olive grove, followed by a four-course food and wine pairing featuring ingredients seen on the tour. 875 Rutherford Road, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 302-2575 Sequoia Grove Courtesy of Sequoia Grove This family-owned winery in Rutherford is a picturesque stop in Napa Valley, where a historic tasting barn (constructed in 1908) is set amidst towering Sequoia redwoods and sustainably-farmed vines. Photo opps aside, the winery is a must-visit for its Taste For Cabernet wine and food experience. Highlighting four culinary delights, prepared by Chef Britny Maureze to enhance the flavors in the wine, A Taste For Cabernet is a delicious way to discover why and how cabernet sauvignon pairs well with a variety of foods. 8338 St. Helena Highway, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 944-2945 Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Kitchen, Courtesy of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars When a Stag's Leap Cabernet Sauvignon triumphed over renowned French Bordeauxs at a blind tasting in 1976, an event now known as the Judgment of Paris, the entire world started to look at California wines with a different, much more favorable, lens. Visitors can try several of the Napa Valley winery's famous cabernet sauvignons during the Cellarious Kitchen Experience while dining on dishes created to \u201cboth complement and contrast their flavors and aromas\u201d and learning the story behind the pairings. 6150 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 257-5790 Peju Winery Courtesy of Peju Winery Peju Winery makes excellent cabernet sauvignon and merlot and also focuses on the guest experience, which makes it a popular Wine Country destination. The Napa Valley Rutherford estate is home to immaculate lawns, gorgeous gardens, meandering footpaths, and a 50-foot tower with a weathered copper roof that is home to the tasting room. The Wine & Dine Private Luncheon can be enjoyed in one of those outdoor gardens for a fancy al fresco picnic or in a vineyard among the vines, where guests will partake in a four-course meal \u201cpaired to perfection\u201d with Peju wines. 8466 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 963-3600 Louis M. Martini Courtesy of Louis M. Martini Louis M. Martini has been crafting world-class cabernet sauvignon since 1933 and is one of Napa's most iconic wineries.

For a more relaxed visit that's perfect for larger groups (up to eight people), there's an Outdoor Cabana Tasting where guests enjoy a family-style, picnic-like meal of Italian-inspired cuisine paired with four wines. 254 St. Helena Highway S, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 968-3362 Robert Mondavi Winery Courtesy of Robert Mondavi Winery Robert Mondavi was the first person to open a major winery in Napa Valley after Prohibition and truly paved the way for all the Napa wineries that followed. He was known for his appreciation of wine and food, so it only makes sense that the winery offers two culinary experiences. First, a leisurely lunch on the patio with views of the gardens and vineyards, paired with tastes of Estate Tier Wines. There's also a Legacy Dinner where guests are able to taste older vintages and rare selections paired with a multi-course meal \u201cthat must be experienced to be believed.\u201d 7801 St. Helena Highway, Oakville, CA 94562, (888) 766-6328 Brian Arden Wines Courtesy of Brian Arden Wines | Angel Wilkes Brian Arden Wines is a small, family-owned business that produces less than 2,500 cases a year, and a relative newcomer to Napa Valley's Calistoga region having \u201cjust\u201d opened in 2015, but the winery has already made a name for itself when it comes to hospitality. The Chef Experience begins with a glass of wine and a tour of the property, which leads to a \u201csubstantial lunch\u201d prepared by the winery's own chef, with pairings either in the open kitchen or on the wraparound patio. 331 Silverado Trail N, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-4767 Joseph Phelps Vineyards Courtesy of Joseph Phelps Vineyards Best known for its flagship wine, Insignia, a blend of red Bordeaux varietals, Joseph Phelps also takes its culinary experiences very seriously. Bountiful Table begins with canap\u00e9s on the outdoor terrace followed by a multi-course lunch of seasonal fare paired with Joseph Phelps Napa Valley and Sonoma Coast wines, including the latest vintage of Insignia. The Chef's Tasting Table is only offered once a month June through September and takes place at an indoor communal table. This \u201cfood adventure\u201d is nine courses, all paired with single-vineyard wines and a library vintage of Insignia. 200 Taplin Road, St. Helena, CA 94574, (800) 707-5789 Ashes & Diamonds Courtesy of Ashes & Diamonds Another newcomer to the Napa Valley scene, Ashes & Diamonds opened in 2017 to immediate fanfare. The winery has a mid-century modern vibe meant to appeal to a younger crowd, but wine enthusiasts of all ages will appreciate the casual, family-style \u201cCalifornia Nouvelle-inspired\u201d food experience. The luncheon features fresh and wood-fired dishes all made with seasonal ingredients, paired perfectly with a selection of Ashes & Diamonds wine. 4130 Howard Lane, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 666-4777 Also worth noting are these Napa Valley wineries that serve tasty and elevated snacks for those looking for a pairing that's on the lighter side.

Priest Ranch Winery goes bold with a Bacon & Wine experience, which is exactly what it sounds like. At Silver Trident Winery , the Potato Chip Extravaganza is a crunchy, fun, salty way to taste wine, as is the Savory Cookie Pairing that can be added to any tasting flight at Tamber Bey Vineyards .

        "title": "Best Wineries for Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon",
        "text": "If you're doing Napa Valley for the first time or the fifteenth, you'll likely be tasting a lot of cabernet sauvignon during your visit. Cabernet is, after all, acknowledged as the king of red grapes in Napa, dominating 40% of the region's total production. With a terroir perfectly suited for growing cabernet, Napa has certainly found its sweet spot with this much loved Bordeaux grape, and the results are powerful, deeply layered, and age-worthy wines showcasing notes of black fruit, violets, tobacco, and cedar, to name a few. Of course, the sheer number of wineries in Napa featuring cabernet and cabernet blends is enough to overwhelm any wine taster, so where to start? To help guide you, we've put together a list of 13 of the most famous names in Napa cabernet welcoming visitors, along with a few lesser known wineries worth noting. Make some room in your cellar, because we have a feeling you'll be going home with a few new bottles. Courtesy of Pine Ridge Vineyards Pine Ridge Vineyards 5901 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 252-9777 Founded in 1978 by Gary Andrus, Pine Ridge Vineyards is located in the heart of the Stags Leap District, recognized for producing distinct and powerful cabernet sauvignon wines. Sourcing grapes from their 160 acres of Napa Green certified estate vineyards, spread throughout five appellations in Napa Valley, Pine Ridge crafts wine to express the special nuances of each individual site. Their flagship wine, FORTIS Cabernet Sauvignon, represents the best blocks of the vineyards and is characterized by its complex fruit flavors, plush mouthfeel, and age-worthy structure. Named one of the 75 Best Wineries to Visit in California by Food & Wine , visitors can choose from the 60-minute Estate Tasting featuring five current release wines, or the Cellar 47 Tour and Tasting, which includes tour through the European-inspired cave as well as a selection of estate cabernet sauvignons. Courtesy of Canard | Adam Fox Canard Vineyard 1016 Dunaweal Lane, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-1149 Canard Vineyard is owned by Rich and Carolyn Czapleski, who purchased the 25-acre property in 1983. From their sustainably-grown, dry farmed grapes, the Czapleskis craft single-vineyard varietal wines and proprietary blends, each highlighting the unique characters of the terroir. Leading with the philosophy, \u201cIf you take care of the vines, the vines will take care of you,\u201d the Czapleskis have earned much praise for their wines, including their zinfandel (from 135-year-old dry farmed vines) and cabernet sauvignon wines. Book a private tasting at the Calistoga winery to experience the wines in person, including the rich and full bodied cabernet, which showcases intense fruit characters, fine tannins, and incredible age-worthiness. Courtesy of Beaulieu Vineyard Beaulieu Vineyard 1960 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 257-5749 Beaulieu Vineyard, or \u201cBV\u201d as it's widely called, is recognized as one of the longest continually operating wineries in Napa Valley, in addition to its prestige as one of the most iconic producers of cabernet sauvignon wines in the region. In fact, many consider BV's legendary Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon to be the first \u201ccult\u201d cabernet in Napa \u2013 a true benchmark for this iconic grape in the region. Needless to say, a visit to this historic winery is a must for cabernet aficionados, who will appreciate the cabernet-focused tasting experiences offered. Opt for the Cabernet Collector Tasting, featuring five current releases, or delve a little deeper with the Georges de Latour Legacy Experience, a more elevated tasting that includes samples of rare older vintages of this famed wine. Courtesy of Cliff Lede Cliff Lede 1473 Yountville Cross Road, Yountville, CA 94599, (707) 944-8642 You don't have to be a wine lover to appreciate Cliff Lede \u2013 where music, art, architecture, and wine intersect \u2013 but serious oenophiles certainly appreciate the winery's selection of limited-production wines \u2013 the most critically-acclaimed of which are the Platinum cabernet sauvignons. While tastings of current releases can be enjoyed in the incredibly picturesque courtyard, the best spot in the house is the Backstage Tasting Lounge. This comfortable indoor lounge features rotating art exhibits, such as portraits of classic rock artists, as well as access to some of the most coveted of Cliff Lede's wines. And, in keeping with the theme, expect rock music playing on the speakers as you savor sips of compelling cabs. Courtesy of Stags' Leap Winery Stags' Leap Winery 6150 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 257-5790 As one of California's earliest wine estates, Stags' Leap Winery has long been a fixture in the famed Stags Leap District of Napa Valley. First established in 1893, the storied estate is dripping in history, including the castle-like Manor House, constructed in 1890 from stone quarried in a nearby hillside, and the \u201cold stone cellar\u201d surrounding the cave. Most of the 85 acres of estate vines are planted to cabernet, petit sirah, and merlot, which thrive in this region. Their flagship wine, The Leap, is a classically styled cabernet filled with rich layers of cassis, blackberry, baking spices, and chocolate, with a smooth, lithe texture. If the higher end bottlings are out of your price range, try Stags' Leap Napa Valley Cabernet, an approachable (and more affordably priced) alternative. Courtesy of Round Pond Round Pond Estate 875 Rutherford Road, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 302-2575 Owned by the MacDonnell family, Round Pond Estate is a respected producer of Napa Valley wines, particularly cabernet sauvignon, as well as world-class olive oil and vinegars from their beautiful estate in Napa Valley's Rutherford AVA. Known for their depth and expressive character, Round Pond's cabernets range in profile, from the Old World meets New World Rutherford Estate Cabernet to the finessed and age-worthy Louis Bovet Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon. Guided tastings range in price and focus, depending on interest, but if cabernet is what you're after, the 90-minute Gravel Series Tasting, featuring current and library releases of this highly allocated cabernet, is not to be missed. Courtesy of Louis M. Martini Louis M. Martini Winery 254 St. Helena Highway South, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 968-3362 Louis M. Martini Winery was one of the first wineries in Napa Valley after Prohibition ended, founded in 1933 by Italian immigrant, Louis M. Martini, who went on to establish the winery as one of the foremost producers of cabernet sauvignon in Napa Valley. After completing an extensive renovation in 2019, Louis M. Martini Winery continues to offer world-class wine paired with welcoming hospitality, now in a stunning new visitor center with numerous indoor and outdoor tasting spaces. Since cabernet is the speciality, expect to taste a variety of cabernet-focused wines, each meticulously sourced from different blocks throughout Martini's several estate vineyards. Courtesy of Crosby Roamann Crosby Roamann 45 Enterprise Ct. #5, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 258-8599 Crosby Roamann is owned by Sean and Juliana McBride, who started their label in 2007 with one barrel of cabernet. Since then, the husband-and-wife duo have taken a minimally invasive approach to winemaking, ensuring every effort is made to craft wines with a true sense of place. Though they produce a few different varietals, such as merlot, chardonnay, and sauvignon blanc, Crosby Roamann is most known for its Reserve Cabernet. Using fruit sourced from Harmony School Vineyard in Coombsville, this limited-production cabernet is pressed entirely by hand (in an old hand-crank press) and spends 24 months in new French oak. The resulting wine shows notes of fresh raspberry, cassis, vanilla, spice, and coffee. Head to their industrial chic winery, located in Napa's Crusher District just a few minutes from downtown, to enjoy a private tour, a tasting of current releases, and even samples straight from the barrel. Courtesy of HALL HALL Napa Valley 401 St. Helena Highway South, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 967-262 Owned by Kathryn and Craig Hall, HALL has built a reputation for its Bordeaux varietals, made from grapes sourced from Hall's 500 acres of estate vineyards and from other esteemed vineyards throughout Napa Valley. Their selection of cabernet wines are much loved by critics and wine lovers alike, regularly striking the perfect balance of ripe fruit, earth, and savory characters. Tasters have not one but two wineries to choose from, thanks to tasting rooms in both St. Helena and Rutherford. The most known of the two is HALL St. Helena, California's first LEED\u00ae Gold Certified winery, which features a one-of-a-kind Bunny Foo-Foo statue, along with over 35 pieces of contemporary art, an expansive lawn, and modern architectural details. Courtesy of Larkmead Vineyards Larkmead Vineyards 1100 Larkmead Lane, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-0167 The 110-acre Larkmead estate is one of the oldest family-owned properties in the Napa Valley, originally founded in 1895. Since purchasing the property in 1992, Cam and Kate Solari Baker have transformed Larkmead into the reputable winery it is today and continue to push the boundaries of what's possible from this estate. A visit to this picturesque winery includes a personalized tasting experience tailored to each guest, taking place on the serene covered patio looking out over the lushly landscaped grounds and surrounding vineyards. While Larkmead's portfolio of wines is diverse, their cabernets are sure to impress. Revealing black fruit, savory herbs, and crushed rock nuances, these thoughtfully crafted cabs are powerful, yet restrained, and entirely elegant. Courtesy of Mira Winery Mira Winery 6170 Washington Street, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 945-0881 Since their first vintage in 2009, Mira Winery has set out to produce handcrafted single-vineyard, single-varietal wines made from select sites in Napa Valley. With a minimalist approach to winemaking, proprietor Jim Dyke, Jr. and winemaker/co-founder Gustavo A. Gonzalez produce a limited amount of highly allocated wines, such as the seductive Mira Schweizer Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, each crafted with ageability in mind. At their Winery & Hospitality House, located just south of Yountville, a guided tour and tasting is the best way to see first-hand the meticulous thought and planning that went into making Mira what it is today. Courtesy of Facebook: Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 5766 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 261-6410 Not to be confused with neighboring Stags' Leap Winery, Stag's Leap Wine Cellars is another well-known Napa Valley winery lauded for its stellar cabernet wines. In fact, this notable winery, founded in 1970, helped make a name for California cabernet when it beat out its French counterparts in the famous blind tasting known as the 1976 Judgment of Paris. Stag's Leap Wine Cellars' highly rated cabs, such as the Cask 23, tend to find a nice balance between rich fruit and savory notes, revealing luscious texture and length on the finish. Tours and tastings are offered by appointment daily at this beautiful winery, from group experiences to guided private tastings. Courtesy of Nickel & Nickel Nickel & Nickel 8164 St. Helena Highway, Oakville, CA 94562, (707) 967-9600 Single vineyard, 100% varietal wines are the focus at Nickel & Nickel, from chardonnay to merlot, but cabernet sauvignon remains the winery's first love and continued inspiration. Hailing from vineyards as far north as Calistoga and Howell Mountain to the Oak Knoll District further south, each of Nickel & Nickel's cabernet wines showcase the various nuances of each vintage and vineyard, whether subtle or more apparent. Though it'll cost you a pretty penny \u2014 $200 per person to be exact \u2014 Nickel & Nickel's Terroir Tasting is a must for serious cabernet fans, offering the rare chance to explore eight of the winery's 100% cabernet sauvignons in a north-to-south comparative tasting. \u2013 An Introduction to Napa Valley AVAs \u2013 \u2013 How to Read a Napa Valley Wine Label \u2013 Author Hana-Lee Sedgwick Hana-Lee Sedgwick is a writer and editor based in Santa Barbara, California.

        "title": "The Best Outdoor Experiences in Napa Valley",
        "text": "With near-perfect weather and sun almost year round, Napa Valley beckons wine lovers out from air-conditioned tasting rooms to spend some time exploring the great outdoors \u2014 and we don't just mean frolicking in the vineyards. From hiking and biking to golfing, camping, and even soaking in the hot springs, here's our guide to Napa Valley's best outdoor experiences. Hike Skyline Wilderness Park, Courtesy of Samanda Dorger-Poccia Easy If wine, wine, and more wine is your priority and you're looking for a quick and easy hike, consider Westwood Hills Park or Alston Park (the most pup friendly), both located in Napa . In just an hour or two, you'll successfully get your heart rate up on some steep climbs, plus take in a spectacular view of the surrounding Napa Valley. You can also head north to Bothe-Napa Valley State Park . Just south of Calistoga , most of the trails here are under two miles. It's also an opportunity to pay a visit to the historic mill at Bale Grist Mill State Park , which has a trail connecting to Bothe-Napa. Moderate The Ritchey Canyon Trail at Bothe-Napa, however, is an eight-mile round trip journey through thick redwoods and over babbling streams. Other longer and moderately challenging hikes can be found at Skyline Wilderness Park in Napa. A hike of the perimeter, which includes a lake and a 1,600-foot summit, stretches for nine miles. The scenic Skyline Trail is a more doable three miles, yet still climbs more than 1,000 feet and circles the lake. A 15 \u2013 20 minute drive from St. Helena, Moore Creek Park is a bit off-the-beaten-path, but worth it, and is your best chance at spotting wildlife (everything from bald eagles and cattle to mountain lions and bobcats). Combine the Chiles Creek Trail with the Shoreline Trail for a 6.4-mile loop that runs adjacent to the serene Lake Hennessey or push yourself on a heart-pumping three-mile climb up the Moore Creek Trail. At the top, a swimming hole awaits. Advanced Napa Valley's most popular hikes are found north of Calistoga at Robert Louis Stevenson State Park , where the revered author spent his honeymoon. The farthest-reaching views of the Bay Area are obtained from over 4,000 feet at the top of the five-mile trail up Mt. St. Helena (10 miles round trip). Most of that hike is on fire road, however, so some hikers prefer hiking the more natural Table Rock and Palisades Trail (eight miles round trip) or even continuing on to the Oak Hill Mine Trail, which extends for 19-miles round trip. Bike Courtesy of Getaway Adventures The eventual goal of the Napa Valley Vine Trail is to complete a 47-mile walking and biking trail system between Vallejo and Calistoga. For now, there is a 12.5-mile section between Napa and Yountville , allowing for 25 leisurely miles round trip. The trail is pretty flat and is a great way to feel less guilty about all of the wine and food you'll be consuming. You can rent bikes from Getaway Adventures , or opt for one of their guided bike tours \u2014 from Carneros to Calistoga \u2014 paired with wine or beer. Mountain bikers can find trails in Skyline Wilderness Park and Moore Creek Park . Advanced riders can tackle 16 miles over 2,800 feet of elevation along the Oat Hill Mine Trail in Robert Louis Stevenson State Park . Camp Bothe-Napa Valley State Park, Courtesy of Napa Valley State Parks Camping opportunities in Napa Valley are limited \u2014 it's all about living the life of luxury in Wine Country \u2014 but Bothe-Napa Valley State Park has 45 campsites for tents and RVs, or you can glamp in one of their 10 furnished Yurts or fully restored historic cabins. You'll easily be able to access the park's hiking trails and there's even a swimming pool. Skyline Wilderness Park also offers tent camping, RV camping, and horse camping. Farther out, Lake Berryessa (a 45-minute drive from Napa) has several lakeside camping opportunities. Check out campgrounds like Spanish Flat Resort , Putah Canyon , Steele Canyon Campground , and Pleasure Cove Campground and Marina . Golf Courtesy of Silverado Resort Despite most of Napa Valley being covered in vineyards, there is a myriad of golf courses in the area. Book a tee time at the beautiful Silverado Resort , which boasts a pair of championship courses and hosts the annual Safeway Open. Note: To play at Silverado, you've also got to stay a night, or just know a member. Kennedy Park and the Mount St. Helena Golf courses are the most accessible and beginner friendly. At Skyline Wilderness Park there's a disc golf course, for a different take on golfing. At Your Leisure Courtesy of Facebook: Old Faithful Geyser of California If you don't exactly want to work up a sweat on your vacation, there are plenty of more leisurely outdoor experiences in Napa Valley. Board a hot air balloon ride at sunrise \u2014 book with Napa Valley Balloons, Inc. or Napa Valley Aloft Balloons . Or, head out to see the Old Faithful Geyser \u2014 one of the most-visited attractions in California \u2014 erupt in Calistoga, then make your way north to take a stroll through fossilized sequoias in the Petrified Forest . To ease your worries (or sore muscles) away, soak in Calistoga's natural hot springs at spots like the newly revamped Dr. Wilkinson's Backyard Resort and Mineral Springs , known as Calistoga's original wellness resort. Many wineries get you outdoors too. Explore 1,682 acres of pristine mountainscape during a tour and tasting at Priest Ranch Winery , or pack a picnic and head to Rutherford Hill Winery to enjoy snacks and a bottle of wine in the scenic Oak Grove overlooking Napa Valley. You can also play a game of bocce at Trinchero Napa Valley while sipping on their estate-grown cabernet. Life in Napa Valley is all about balance. So of course sip amazing wines and dine at world-class restaurants, but also set aside some time to get outside and explore the region beyond the vines. \u2013 Your Culture Guide to Napa Valley \u2013 \u2013 Make a Splash in Napa Valley \u2013 Author Jess Lander Jess Lander is a freelance wine, food and travel writer based in Napa Valley and exploring all things California wine country.

        "title": "New in Napa Valley in 2022: Where to Eat, Sip & Stay",
        "text": "Despite a difficult two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Napa Valley continues to prove why it's the premier wine destination in not only California, but also North America. Every year brings a slew of new and unique wine experiences, luxury hotels and resorts, and world-class dining that makes Napa the complete vacation package. If it's been a while since you really traveled, Napa Valley is the perfect place to dip your toes and treat yourself for lost time. From Champagne and caviar lounges to splurge-worthy, five-star resorts to cabernet that absolutely slays, here are all the new places to discover in Napa Valley in 2022. New + Refreshed Stays A Calistoga Renaissance Four Seasons Resorts & Residences Napa Valley, Courtesy of Four Seasons Resorts The small town of Calistoga, on Napa Valley's northern end, was the talk of Wine Country in 2021. Not only did the Four Seasons Resorts & Residences Napa Valley finally open after several years of delays \u2014 complete with a restaurant, spa, two pools (one adults only), a poolside cantina, on-site winery, and luxury rooms with vineyard and mountain views \u2014 but several other Calistoga hotels got a facelift. Dr. Wilkinson's Backyard Resort & Mineral Hot Springs, Courtesy of Dr. Wilkinson's Backyard Resort Dr. Wilkinson's Backyard Resort & Mineral Hot Springs completed a head-to-toe renovation of its 1952 hotel, turning it into a chic and nostalgic playground made for young couples, families, and visitors on a budget. While you're there, experience a traditional mud bath \u2014 a concept that was actually born at this very hotel \u2014 or perhaps a CBD massage, and enjoy a healthy-ish meal of Southwestern cuisine at House of Better (get the Green Chile Apple Pie for dessert). Solage made updates to its restaurant patio, pool, and rooms, plus added a killer pool bar, Pico, where you can grab duck mole tacos, spicy cocktails, and a unique guac made out of whipped avocado, pistachio, and kale dip. The Calistoga Motor Lodge + Spa , a reimagined roadside motel with a retro bathhouse and trio of mineral springs pools, added a set of elevated rooms with a view on top of its new wood-fired-themed restaurant, Fleetwood. Sky High Luxury Walt Whitman Suite, Courtesy of Poetry Inn Few visitors to Napa have heard of the ultra-luxe Poetry Inn , perched high on a hill above Yountville with unparalleled views. Owned by the same family behind Cliff Lede Vineyards, the inn underwent a total, contemporary design refresh from locally-famous interior designer Erin Martin and not only is it incredibly intimate with just five apartment-sized suites, it has a pool, spa, and gives the larger resorts a run for their money. Coming Soon Napa Valley's third Auberge Collection resort, Stanly Ranch , will open in south Napa this year. Built on a historic, 700-acre ranch that's surrounded by bucolic rolling hills, guests can expect the same level of luxury design and hospitality that Solage and Auberge du Soleil offer. New Wineries One Day, Three Wineries This trio of wineries would make for the perfect itinerary on the Silverado Trail in Napa, as they're all within a six-mile stretch of road. There was a lot of movement in 2021 on the south end of what locals call \u201cThe Trail,\u201d starting with an oldie, but a goodie. Burgess Cellars , a historic winery that was founded in 1972 on Howell Mountain, sadly lost much of its winery and tasting room in the 2020 Glass Fire but found a new home last year in what was formerly Luna Vineyards. Enjoy an outdoor garden tasting featuring some library vintages of Burgess wines and keep an eye out for new experiences and events this coming year, like a caviar and sparkling wine lounge. Bread & Butter Wines Tasting Room, Courtesy of Bread & Butter Wines Not far up the road from Burgess, the chill and unpretentious Bread & Butter tasting room opened last summer. Taste at a cozy, modern home where Bread & Butter Wines (one of the fastest-growing brands in America) is planning to launch a totally unique tasting experience in 2022: a wine and butter pairing, featuring artisanal jars of butter (with bread, of course) made to match specific wines. Baldacci Family Vineyards, Courtesy of Baldacci Family Vineyards Stop at the Soda Canyon Store for lunch and then drive a couple more miles north to Baldacci Family Vineyards , which finally completed a multi-year renovation of their tasting room and winery. This family-owned-and-run winery established in 1998 has some of the best views of the famed Stags Leap District from their massive veranda and glass-walled hospitality center called \u201cStag Hall.\u201d Wine for Good If you want to feel a little less guilty about all of the wine you're sipping on your next Wine Country trip, check out the new OneHope , which is all about giving back. This state-of-the-art winery and hospitality barn set in Oakville uses wine as a vessel to raise funds for global issues related to health, hunger, poverty, and education. Book the Wine & Bites experience and before you head out, stop by the marketplace, which OneHope has stocked with handmade items from artisans around the world. One of a Kind Elusa Winery, Courtesy of Elusa The new Four Seasons Napa Valley has its own on-site winery called Elusa , where one of Napa's most renowned consulting winemakers, Thomas Rivers Brown, has set up shop. You don't have to be a guest of the resort to reserve a tasting here, where both the cabernet and the setting are on a five-star level. Coming Soon It's hard to keep up with the openings happening in downtown Napa, but one to keep an eye out for is Brendel Wines , which will open downtown on First St. sometime this year. This new wine brand is bringing a fresh perspective to Napa by crafting organically-farmed, pure wines that speak to Napa Valley's history and aren't overpriced \u2014 we're talking Napa Valley-made wines that range from $28-60 (run, don't walk). New Restaurants Tiki Time Food and drink at Wilfred's Lounge, Courtesy of Wilfred's Lounge One of Napa's most anticipated restaurant openings in 2021 came last fall in the form of a tiki bar downtown. Overlooking the Napa River (it even has a rooftop terrace), Wilfred's Lounge offers something completely new in Wine Country. Sip Wilfred's version of a Mai Tai or other tropical drinks, like the Blue Hawaii, Pagan Ritual, or On Island Thyme (get it?). For food, the salmon candy rangoons, spam sliders, and chicken skewers will transport you right to a virtual island paradise. Pinkies Up Courtesy of Regiis Ova Caviar Last summer, Chef Thomas Keller unveiled yet another eatery, his sixth in the tiny town of Yountville. Outside of The French Laundry, this is the fanciest dining experience yet, celebrating two of life's greatest gifts: Champagne and caviar. Swing by the Regiis Ova Caviar & Champagne Lounge for just that and some fun bites like deviled eggs or Wagyu tartare (both topped with caviar), snow crab legs, and truffle grilled cheese. Coming Soon In early 2022, Loveski , a \u201cJew-ish\u201d deli concept from Chef Christopher Kostow (of the three Michelin-starred The Restaurant at Meadowood and The Charter Oak) and his wife Martina Kostow will open at the Oxbow Public Market, serving up bagels and schmear and killer pastrami on rye. Also slated to open in Napa Valley later this year is The Slanted Door , a Wine Country outpost from the famed San Francisco Vietnamese restaurant, and a new St. Helena restaurant from two volunteer firefighter friends, one of which is a 10-year French Laundry alum, called Charlies'. Fresh Pours Napa obviously has its share of wine bars and while you likely have your favorites, there are three new spots worth checking out, like Ox and the Fox, located right in the heart of downtown on First St. and inside the First & Franklin Marketplace, which also happens to make a mean deli sandwich. Ox and the Fox is small, super casual, and a great alternative when the line at Cadet (just around the corner) is too long on the weekends. Don't miss the snacks, like a goat cheese fondue. The Yard at Feast it Forward, Courtesy of Feast it Forward Feast it Forward , a wine tasting collective, TV studio, and design showroom in one, expanded at the end of 2021 at its eclectic Oxbow District location to include The Yard, a music festival-inspired outdoor space with a huge stage, picnic tables, lawn games, and double-decker wine lounges made out of repurposed storage containers. The Yard frequently hosts concerts, pop-ups, and other fun events, so keep an eye on their website calendar. Bay Grape is technically a wine shop, but since opening last year, it's become a sort of best-kept secret of Napa's local wine industry, known as the spot to procure obscure wines that go beyond Napa and California and you won't find anywhere else in town. Bay Grape offers a weekly wine flight by a featured producer and any bottle you purchase can be enjoyed on their patio for a $10 corkage fee. On Sundays, that corkage is waived on all Champagne (huzzah!). Coming Soon Though not a wine bar, a new cocktail bar called The Fink should be on your radar for 2022. Set to open inside The Napa River Inn, this project comes from Napa's unofficial mayor and vintner Judd Finklestein of Judd's Hill Winery. Finklestein founded a Napa Valley cocktail appreciation guild back in 2004, just in case anyone was doubting his credentials. Hop to It The sister outpost of Big Stump Brewing Company in Sacramento, Napa Barrel Project is a new brew pub in downtown Napa that's focused on aging beers in barrels sourced from Napa Valley wineries (they even have a wine list featuring bottles and glasses from those same wineries). Pair either with a pizza from their menu, like the Spanish Pizza topped with chorizo, olives, and onions. Courtesy of Fieldwork Brewing Berkeley-based Fieldwork Brewing recently moved its Napa taproom from the Oxbow Public Market to a new standalone space around the corner that's much bigger, has a large beer garden, and for the first time, serves food. Try Your Luck Courtesy of Ace & Vine Napa isn't exactly known for its nightlife, but a new cardroom called Ace & Vine opened last year, providing a new form of late-night entertainment in Wine Country. Open 24/7 \u2014 yes, really \u2014 pick your poison between Blackjack, Texas Holdem, Baccarat, Three Card Poker, and Pai Gow Poker. Ace & Vine doubles as a restaurant, serving a mash-up of American and Asian dishes indoors or on a big, riverside deck. \u2013 Best Wineries to Visit in Yountville \u2013 \u2013 Airports Near Napa Valley \u2013 A Traveler's Guide \u2013 Author Jess Lander Jess Lander is a freelance wine, food and travel writer based in Napa Valley and exploring all things California wine country.

        "title": "How to Throw a Sparkling Wine Party in Six Simple Steps",
        "text": "\u2018Tis the season for twinkling lights, cozy nights, and bubbly. Sparkling wine can and should be enjoyed year-round (not just on New Year's and other special occasions), but we can't deny that it's especially primed for the holiday season. So, as you start to plan your annual festivities, why not throw a sparkling wine-themed party? Nobody does it better than Napa's iconic chateau, Domaine Carneros , so we asked them for some tips on throwing the perfect sparkling soir\u00e9e that's equal parts elegant, easy, and fun. Channel your inner Audrey Hepburn and follow these six easy steps to a bubbly good time. Step 1: Select the wines The wine is obviously the most crucial component to your sparkling wine party and selecting a variety will not only ensure that you have something for everyone, but also encourage your guests to explore different styles of sparkling wine. You don't have to splurge on expensive French Champagnes. High quality sparkling wines can be found at a much more approachable price point from wineries like Domaine Carneros, which employ the same method traditionelle (meaning the wine undergoes a second fermentation in the bottle) as used by French Champagne houses. Choose wines that are both dry (like an Ultra Brut) and sweet (like a Demi-sec), or sparklings made with different grape varieties. For example, Blanc de Blancs, like Domaine Carneros' Le R\u00eave, are crafted with 100 percent chardonnay grapes, while Blanc De Noirs are made solely with pinot noir grapes. Others are blends. This Sparkling Classics trio is a great place to start, or opt for the Sumptuous Sparkling Sampler for something a little more special. For a true party-pleaser, throw a late-disgorged sparkling wine into the mix. These wines spend more time aging on the lees (yeast) in the bottle, which results in an added complexity and rich, nutty flavors. When considering how much wine to purchase for your party, keep in mind that each bottle of sparkling wine yields about eight glasses. Expect each guest to have at least one drink per hour, so multiply your guest count by the number of hours your get-together will run, then divide that number by eight. You can also use an online drink calculator, like this one from Evite . It doesn't hurt to add a few extra bottles. Nothing stops a good time quicker than a wine shortage and if you have leftovers, you get to drink it. Step 2: Prepare simple, light bites Every good party needs food, but don't feel the need to go overboard. The goal is to enjoy yourself and engage with your guests \u2014 not spend your entire soir\u00e9e stuck in the kitchen \u2014 so keep it simple and choose small bites or appetizers that can be prepared quickly with little to no cooking time. Luckily, sparkling wine is one of the easiest wines to pair food with. It truly goes well with almost anything, so you don't need to stress over conflicting flavors. Cheese and charcuterie never fail, but popcorn is another foolproof option that's affordable, quick and easy, fun, and as a bonus, on theme with the popping of corks. Serve with an array of seasonings so that party-goers can experiment with different pairings. But if you really want to get creative, international spices and salty foods go surprisingly well with sparkling wine, including caviar, chips, and Asian and Moroccan flavors \u2014 so much so that Domaine Carneros even built some food and wine experiences around these, offered at their Carneros winery. Feel free to get inspired to cook up something fun at home, but if Moroccan food isn't in your repertoire, just order takeout from your favorite, local spot, plate it, and no one will know that their host wasn't busy in the kitchen all day. Step 3: Choose your glassware Some people think that you need a special shape of glass for each type of wine, but Domaine Carneros' team doesn't believe in taking things so seriously. While flutes or coupes (shallow bowls) are traditionally used for sparkling wine, a standard wine glass will work just fine. Or, mix and match your glassware to keep things light and fun. Domaine Carneros sells a set of six stemless, gold-embossed flutes in a mix of patterns that come with a bottle of Brut Ros\u00e9. Or, you can check out this set of four elegantly etched flutes to go with your bubbly. You may also consider picking up some wine glass charms to help your guests keep track of their glasses. This will save you time on dishes later. Step 4: Decorate You can keep it simple when it comes to d\u00e9cor too. Fresh flowers and table confetti go a long way to making a party pop, as do gold, silver, and white ornaments and ribbon. For something unique that is sure to delight your guests, freeze fresh cut roses or your favorite flower into an ice tray and then place these flower ice cubes in your chiller or ice bucket. When your friends go to refresh their glass, they'll be greeted by this beautiful, unexpected surprise. Here's how to make your own floral ice cubes . Step 5: Make it interactive Place tasting score cards by the wine (with pens) and encourage your guests to fill them out. These are a great tool for sparking conversations, so feel free to get creative or find some to print online. Conveniently, Domaine Carneros offers bubbly tasting cards you can print at home. The tasting score cards will prompt your guests to sip thoughtfully \u2014 considering the colors, aromas, and flavors of each wine \u2014 and then discuss and debate their favorites with other party guests. 6. Be ready to serve The second-most important ingredient to your wine party, after the sparkling wine, is ice. Buy a lot of it, so that you don't risk running out. Bubbly simply doesn't taste good warm. Make sure you have multiple wine chillers or ice buckets on hand so that you can keep all of your wines cold at once. Check out this sleek and practical wine chiller from Domaine Carneros, which keeps your bottle cold for up to nine hours (not that it'll last that long) and makes a statement in your home. For multiple bottles, a large galvanized tub works, but if you want to go the most affordable route, simply use your kitchen sink! Scrub it clean, fill it with ice, and slide the bottles in. Put your wine on ice long before your guests arrive, but if you're running late or forget, there is an easy hack for chilling your wine in half the time. Add a few tablespoons of salt to your ice bucket, stir it occasionally, and the bottle will be ready to pop in about 15 \u2013 20 minutes. Et voila! Now that you have all the essential tips for throwing the perfect sparkling wine party, it's time to pop those corks and share your sparkling party experience by tagging @domainecarneros . Of course, you don't need a lot of guests to throw a sparkling wine party this season. In fact, a party of two sipping bubbly in front of the fire is perfectly acceptable in our book.

        "title": "Top 8 Rutherford Wineries to Visit",
        "text": "Nestled between Oakville and St. Helena in Napa Valley, California, the Rutherford AVA produces some of Napa's finest wines. For cabernet lovers, this is where to come to taste the rich, opulent, structured cab Napa is famous for. Not surprising, Rutherford wineries also produce delicious Bordeaux blends to further intoxicate red wine fans. We know that terroir drives uniqueness in wine, and Rutherford's special flavor profile is the result of its distinct deep gravel and sandy soils, coupled with the area's microclimate, which create a longer growing season and hang time. The wine's tannins are rounded out with a soft, dusty style, imparting such a distinct signature that it's known as \u201cRutherford Dust.\u201d For many fans of Rutherford wines, it's an utterly addicting element that keeps them coming back vintage after vintage. To taste the best of Napa Valley's Rutherford wineries, follow our two-day tasting itinerary. As a reminder, due to COVID-19 the wineries now require reservations for visits and tastings. Courtesy of St. Supery Estate / Sarah Sternberg St. Supery Estate Vineyards & Winery 8440 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 963-4507 If you want to drink incredible 100 percent estate wines and help the planet out at the same time, choose to imbibe at the certified Napa Green winery of St. Sup\u00e9ry. Known for its cabernet sauvignon and Bordeaux bottles, and its commitment to sustainability, reserve either the Cabernet Sauvignon Collector's Tasting or the Five Bordeaux Varietals and Your Five Senses experience when visiting. Either tasting will give you the opportunity to sample wines so good that in 2015 the winery was purchased by fashion icon Chanel Inc. No doubt, Coco and cab are a perfect pairing! Speaking of pairings, if a food pairing is what you're after, you'll enjoy the Taste of the Estate experience, which includes four wines paired with small bites highlighting seasonal ingredients grown on-site. Insider Tip : Don't miss checking out the art gallery on the winery's second floor. Exhibits change throughout the year. Courtesy of Peju / Katie Gallogly Peju Winery 8466 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 963-3600 Family owned, and led by visionary Tony Peju, the Father of Custom Crush, Peju Winery is known for its classic Bordeaux varietals shining on their own, like the Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, or blended into intoxicating bottles like the 2016 Sketches, a blend of cabernet and merlot. Book a private Wine and Dine luncheon to experience a variety of Peju wines while sitting in the beautiful garden. You're likely to see the matriarch of the family, Herta Peju, digging in the dirt to ensure the roses and dahlias are creating a bouquet as intoxicating as that of their wines. Insider Tip : Visit the charming, 50-foot tower on property that graces all estate-bottled Peju labels. It also happens to be one of the tallest buildings in Napa Valley. Courtesy of Beaulieu Vineyard Beaulieu Vineyard (BV) 1960 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 257-5749 Since 1900 when Georges des Latour founded Beaulieu with the goal to create wine that rivaled those found in his native France, \u201cBV\u201d has been a pioneer in Napa Valley. For many years its winemaker was the legendary \u201cMaestro\u201d Andr\u00e9 Tchelistcheff. His Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon was the first cult cab in Napa and is still considered one of the best today. Insider Tip : For the ultimate tasting, schedule the 120-minute Georges de Latour Legacy Experience where you'll have the chance to try the legendary wine BV is known for. Courtesy of Grgich Hills Estate / Ken Morris Grgich Hills Estate 1829 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 963-2784 Napa Valley wines gained international acclaim at the 1976 Paris Tasting when the 1973 Chateau Montelena Chardonnay bested all the storied white Burgundies to be named best white wine in the world. Mike Grgich was the winemaker that crafted that famous wine. After the shocking victory, he and his sister founded Grgich Hills Estate. Not surprisingly, it's chardonnay that reigns supreme here, each bottling made from their certified organic vineyards. Insider Tip : Book the Picnic Experience to enjoy a customized tasting and lunch in the winery's picnic area. Make sure to add on the Grape Stomp, where a wine educator will lead your group on an epically memorable grape stomp. Courtesy of Rutherford Hill Winery Rutherford Hill Winery 200 Rutherford Hill Road, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 963-1871 Cab may be king in Rutherford, but up on Rutherford Hill it's merlot that reigns supreme. The vineyard's founders noted that this area had a climate and soil similar to France's famous merlot AOC, Pomerol, and they went all in on the varietal. Today 75 percent of Rutherford Hill wine is merlot. Insider Tip : Go spelunking for great wine. Rutherford Hill is known for its historic wine caves, which you can explore on the private cave tour that ends with a tasting of five wines crafted by winemaker Marisa Taylor. Courtesy of Groth Vineyards & Winery Groth Vineyards & Winery 750 Oakville Cross Road, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 754-4254 Pac-Man would gladly gobble up the award-winning wine at Groth Vineyards & Winery. The family-owned vineyard was founded by the former CFO of Atari, and first jumped on the international wine scene when its 1985 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon became the first American wine given 100-points by Robert Parker. In 2019, the 2016 Reserve Cab was named the fourth best wine in Wine Spectator's prestigious Top 100 list. Insider Tip : Taste Groth's cabernet sauvignon legacy with the Single Vineyard Cabernet Tasting, a 60-minute experience that showcases how small variances in soil, climate, and topography can affect the character of a wine. Courtesy of Napa Cellars Napa Cellars 7481 St. Helena Highway South, Oakville, CA 94562, (707) 944-2565 If your palate is getting a little tired of Napa cabs, head to Napa Cellars to taste a wide variety of varietals from chardonnay and sauvignon blanc to pinot noir and zinfandel. The Reserve tasting will highlight the best small-lot wines crafted by winemaker Joe Shirley, while the Winemaker tasting features some of his favorite lesser-known red varietals. Insider Tip : Enjoy your tasting in the unique geodesic domed tasting room commissioned by Napa Cellar's founder Charlie Woods. Courtesy of Inglenook Inglenook 1991 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 84573, (707) 968-1161 Started in 1879, Inglenook has ushered in a series of firsts in Napa Valley, including the first merlot vines planted, one of the first gravity flow wineries, and the first bottling assembly line. Since buying the winery in 1975, filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola has been the Godfather at Inglenook. The winery is known for its Rubicon estate Bordeaux-style red wine, which has been made since 1978. Insider Tip : To learn more about the legacy and wines of Inglenook opt for the Private Library Tour and Tasting, a sommelier-led library tasting in the historic Inglenook Chateau, or choose to design your own curated experience to discover more about the estate and its wines. \u2013 The 10 Most Beautiful Wineries in Napa Valley \u2013 \u2013 2-Day Wine Tasting Itinerary in St. Helena \u2013 Author Dena Roche Dena Roch\u00e9 is a freelance wine and travel journalist who has visited over 35 wine regions of the world.

        "text": "Wine and music collide at JaM Cellars , a one-of-a-kind, music-themed tasting room in downtown Napa. While this part of town used to have a reputation for being a little bit sleepy, JaM Cellars is breathing new life into Napa's nightlife with their JaMSessions, an ongoing series of intimate, wine-fueled concerts that keep the party going long after dinner. JaM Cellars is the brainchild of music lovers John and Michele Truchard, the \u201cJ\u201d and \u201cM\u201d in JaM. As second-generation Napa Valley vintners, the Truchards have had a long history in crafting fine wines, but with JaM Cellars, they wanted to do something different by introducing super-approachable and affordable every-day wines to the market. These wines are made to be enjoyed with friends in a not-so-serious setting, so John and Michele designed a fun and unconventional tasting space, the JaM Cellars Wine & Music Studio, located on downtown Napa's First Street . The Setting While JaM Cellars is a cool wine tasting spot during the day, it morphs into an incredibly cozy events venue with live music in the evenings, Thursday through Saturday. Napa Valley has a handful of larger concert venues, like the Uptown Theatre or the Napa Valley Opera House which houses both Blue Note Napa and the JaM Cellars Ballroom, but for the opportunity to comfortably lounge mere feet from the band, JaMSessions feel like a private show. You'll want to reserve a spot and arrive early to snag the best view in the house, a collection of leather couches and chairs set up like a living room right by the stage, with Persian rugs and tables cleverly shaped like guitar picks. There's also a handful of booths for groups and a few stools at the bar. Many guests simply choose to stand \u2014 it certainly makes dancing easier \u2014 but either way, there's never the feeling of the space being overcrowded like a traditional concert. JaM Cellars stays open much later (10pm Sunday \u2013 Wednesday and midnight Thursday \u2013 Saturday) than its downtown Napa counterparts and music is on theme everywhere you look. A private tasting room doubles as a fully-equipped recording studio, where the winery hosts virtual JaMHappyHours Wednesdays and Thursdays at 4pm and there's also a state-of-the-art sound system, disco ball, an impressive vinyl collection, and vintage Rolling Stone magazine art plastered all over the walls, bringing you back in time to some of your favorite musicians in their heyday. The Music A mere $10 cover charge will get you in to enjoy their JaMSessions, which welcome a variety of acts both local and from further afield. The night I attended featured a JaM Cellars regular, the Eric Wiley Trio, a Funk/Reggae band with a Jazz flair. The songs were all covers of old classics \u2014 like the Steve Miller Band's Space Cowboy , Get Up Stand Up by Bob Marley, and The Eagles' Hotel California \u2014 and almost everyone in the room was either dancing or singing along (or both). At times, I could close my eyes and imagine myself on a tropical island, pi\u00f1a colada in hand. These events take place on most Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, but check JaM Cellars Facebook page or website for listings. Live music on Thursdays is from 8pm-10pm while on Fridays and Saturdays the music runs from 9pm-11pm. With JaM Cellars' connection to BottleRock Napa Valley (they are a five-time Presenting Sponsor) there's a chance you'll catch artists that also play the music festival (like Sam Johnson, Chris Pierce, and Mondo Cozmo). Other acts include nationally-acclaimed, touring artists (like Witherward), while others are based right in Napa Valley (including Full Chizel and JourneyDay). Book online via Tock to secure your spot. The Wine The wine is flowing all night long from the bar, available for purchase by the glass, flight, or bottle. You may know JaM Cellars for their popular Californian wines priced at under $20: the classic Butter Chardonnay, their signature JaM Cabernet, bubbles in the form of Toast Sparkling, and Sugar Sweet White, a Moscato. But don't pass up the chance to try their Napa Valley releases exclusive to the JaM Cellars wine and music studio. Sip these side-by-side with their Californian counterparts for a fun taste test, or try the Napa Valley-only JaM Cellars Sauvignon Blanc and JaM Cellars Pinot Noir. There really is a wine here for everyone! Reservations are highly recommended through ExploreTock.com/JaMCellars . See you there!

        "title": "Your Guide to Cannabis in Wine Country",
        "text": "Welcome to your ultimate guide to cannabis in Wine Country! Whether you're new to cannabis or a frequent cannabis user doing research for a future trip to Northern California, we want you to be as informed as possible. Our guide takes you through everything you need to know to buy, consume, and experience cannabis legally in Wine Country. While we admit there is quite a bit of information to cover here, we've divided this article into sections to make it easier to use as a reference tool. Feel free to read straight through or see our outline below to skip ahead to a certain topic. Before we dive in, we want to just point out that, like the alcohol-related activities you may enjoy in Wine Country, if you plan to use cannabis, please do so responsibly and safely (try not to skip the \u2018rules' section). Now that we've got that out of the way, it's time to talk all things cannabis! History How it started, how cannabis became legal in California Rules How it works, what are the rules, what you can and can't do Buying Cannabis \u2022 Types of Dispensaries \u2013 recreational versus medical \u2022 What to expect when visiting a dispensary \u2022 Where to purchase \u2013 Leading dispensaries in Sonoma and Napa Counties \u2022 Delivery \u2013 how to order, delivery radius, and more Consuming Cannabis \u2022 What is THC vs. CBD \u2022 Types of Products Cannabis in Wine Country \u2022 What to know about wine & weed \u2022 Spas, Health & Wellness + Cannabis \u2022 Cannabis Tours & Experiences \u2022 Safe Cannabis Use History How it all started in California Why you should care Just call California \u201cCannabis Country.\u201d Why? The state has long been at the forefront of the movement to legalize cannabis in the United States and it's been estimated that 60 percent or more of all marijuana consumed in the U.S. comes from Northern California. In 1972, California had the first ballot initiative in the U.S. attempting to legalize cannabis (Proposition 19). It was unsuccessful, but that didn't stop them from trying and eventually, California became the first state to legalize medical cannabis with the passage of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. 20 years later, they took another big step forward when California voters approved the Adult Use of Marijuana Act ( Proposition 64 ), which enables adults to legally use, grow, and transport marijuana for personal use \u2014 no medical marijuana card required (must be 21 or over). Rules How it works, what are the rules, what you can and can't do With the passage of California's Prop. 64, adults aged 21 and older are allowed to purchase, possess, and transport, up to one ounce \u2014 the equivalent of roughly 28 grams \u2014 of dried marijuana, or up to eight grams of cannabis concentrate (oils, edibles, topicals). Pro tip: that's a lot of cannabis! But just because cannabis is legal, doesn't mean there aren't still rules. Cannabis cannot be smoked in any public place, anywhere that tobacco is prohibited (which will apply to most/all restaurants and bars), and it cannot be possessed or used within 1,000 feet of a daycare, school, or youth center while children are present, for obvious reasons. In case you were wondering\u2026 driving under the influence of cannabis is still very much illegal \u2014 yes, you can get a marijuana DUI, and the penalties are similar to alcohol DUIs. So just be aware you can't smoke, drink or ingest it while driving or even while riding in the passenger seat. This one probably stings the most for visitors, but it is also illegal to transport marijuana, purchased or obtained in California, across state lines. This means that if you're traveling from out of state, you cannot legally bring any cannabis products purchased back home, whether you're flying or driving. So sorry, cousin Fred, the weed cookies will have to wait. If you're visiting from outside of California, consider your time in state and how much you'll actually use; it's very likely that you don't need to purchase the max amount allowed. Buying Cannabis How and Where? You can legally purchase cannabis products in two ways: 1. Physical Dispensaries (recreational and medical) 2. Delivery services Dispensaries Types of Dispensaries Okay, you've got the history and rules down, so now all you need to do is make your purchase, right? Before you do, it's important to understand that there are two types of dispensaries in California: recreational and medical. A recreational dispensary does not require a medical cannabis card. In order to shop at a recreational dispensary, you just need to show your ID to prove that you're 21 years of age or older. A medical dispensary does require a medical cannabis card and proof that you're 18 years or older. These days, medical cards can be obtained pretty quickly and easily online (more on that below). Now, we know what you're thinking: If cannabis is legal in California, why aren't all dispensaries recreational? When it comes to Wine Country, there are more than a dozen recreational dispensaries in Sonoma County, but Napa County currently only allows medical dispensaries. What to Expect When You Visit a Dispensary Step 1 \u2013 Bring Your ID We covered this point above, but let's hit again to be safe. The most important thing to remember when going to a dispensary is to bring a valid ID (a state-issued ID card, state-issued driver's license, or passport) to prove you're of legal age. Dispensaries take these ID requirements seriously, so you should absolutely expect that your ID will be checked and scanned before you're allowed entrance, even if you're just \u201cwindow shopping\u201d or tagging along with someone that will ultimately be purchasing. Step 2 \u2013 Bring Cash Dispensaries only accept cash. We realize that's a strange concept in today's world of Venmo, Square, and other cashless payments, so why cash only? The short answer is that even though cannabis is legal in California, marijuana remains illegal under federal law. As a result, most financial institutions are not willing to provide financial services to dispensaries, such as credit card processing (see our FAQs section for more details on this). To be safe, we recommend swinging by an ATM before you visit. Step 3 \u2013 Shop and Ask Questions Most dispensaries are well designed and comfortable, similar to a high-end retail shop with a variety of product options organized by category. You will also be able to purchase any equipment needed for consumption, like rolling papers, pipes, and vape pens. Like wineries, dispensaries come in all sizes; some are large with a vast selection while others are more boutique and intentional with their product curation. It's best to treat the shopping experience like an art gallery, not a grab-n-go. Take your time, check out the different offerings, and most importantly, don't be afraid to ask questions, for the products come in varying levels of potency and offer an array of effects. Pro tip: you will not be allowed to sample or consume products in a dispensary (another one of those pesky rules). Lean on staff members \u2014 often referred to as \u201c budtenders \u201d (seriously, yes) \u2014 to help you make your selections. They can lay out everything you can expect to experience, suggest how much you should consume, and help you find the best match for a hike, relaxing by the pool, or just enjoying the scenery. The legalization of cannabis is still fairly new in California, so these budtenders act like pharmacists, happy to take the time to answer questions and educate newbies, so definitely take advantage of their knowledge and guidance Step 4 \u2013 Pay Cannabis products range vastly in price and the additional tax on cannabis purchases causes the jaws of many new cannabis consumers to drop. So, don't say we didn't warn you: Be prepared to pay an additional 35 percent (on average) after state, local, and excise cannabis taxes. Pro tip: Some dispensaries add taxes into the listed price of products, so ask the budtender if tax is included to make sure you understand the full price before you check out. Pro tip 2: You cannot return products once you purchase, so make sure you know exactly what you want before you check out. We recommend buying in smaller quantities to start if you're a first-time user of a particular product.

CANNABIS DELIVERY Like everything else in the digital age, you can also buy cannabis online and have it delivered to your door. Yep, we're serious. Delivery companies offer on-demand delivery of cannabis products all throughout California. Here is how it works: Step 1: Find the Right Delivery Company. There are companies that specialize in cannabis delivery and then there are dispensaries that also offer delivery services. When selecting a delivery company, make sure they deliver to your address (house, hotel or vacation rental). For example, many delivery companies will not deliver to some addresses in Napa Valley. See dispensaries section above and delivery-only companies below in this section. Step 2: Have Cash. Delivery companies only accept cash, so be sure you have cash before placing your order. Step 3: Place Order Online. Visit the delivery company website, select your products, and complete the check out process. Some companies like SPARC have both a dispensary and delivery service. Browse and order your products directly through the SPARC website and they will then deliver your order. Most cannabis orders are delivered in 1-2 hours depending on your location and the time of your order. Similar to a food delivery service, if you order during the peak demand times, your order could take longer to be delivered, so plan accordingly. Each delivery company communicates differently, but most provide delivery confirmation and updates via text message.

Note: See Delivery Regions and Minimum Purchase requirements here Online Ordering: YES Napa Cannabis Collective Hours: Daily 12:00 PM \u2013 7:00 PM Delivery Radius: Napa County and Sonoma Country (check specific addresses) Online Ordering: YES Consuming Cannabis Choose Your Own Adventure The sheer amount of options for consuming cannabis can be overwhelming and intimidating, especially because each product offers a different experience and can be entirely unique in how (and when) it affects your body. But this isn't a bad thing. Recent innovations in the industry \u2014 fueled by wider acceptance and legalization \u2014 have resulted in seemingly unlimited possibilities for safe experimentation and use. The world, as they say, is your oyster. Let's start with the basics: THC vs. CBD You are going to hear and see these two acronyms a lot, so let's break it down. Both CBD and THC are cannabinoids derived from the cannabis plant, but there's one major difference: THC is psychoactive and CBD is not. What does that mean, exactly? Psychoactive is a term applied to chemical substances that change a person's mental state by affecting the way the brain and nervous system work. Alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine are all psychoactive products. So, if a cannabis product includes THC on the label, it will likely make you \u201cfeel high\u201d depending on the amount you consume. CBD on the other hand is NOT psychoactive, so you will NOT \u201cfeel high\u201d when using cannabis with only CBD. CBD-only products are most commonly used for pain management and to relieve stress and anxiety, so you can put the Cheetos and other munchies away for the time being. But in all seriousness, studies have shown CBD can also help manage symptoms for a variety of medical conditions, including arthritis, anxiety, and general pain relief. The popularity of spa treatments incorporating CBD-based oils is growing rapidly. When purchasing cannabis, the products will clearly state what cannabinoids it includes (THC or CBD, or both). You'll find that many products are actually hybrids that contain both. How to Consume Cannabis Cannabis products (both CBD and THC) have evolved significantly over the past 15 years thanks to legalization. A surge of new products on the market offers consumers the option to eat, drink, rub, vape, and of course, smoke cannabis products. Frankly, it can all be a little overwhelming. However, this is where a budtender can be really helpful. They will listen to how you want to feel (relaxed) or what you are seeking (sleep aid) and then recommend specific products. Here is a quick cheat sheet on the different cannabis product categories. Flowers (classic marijuana buds smoked) \u2013 today's flower cannabis has lots of variety. Whether you want to mellow out, perk up, or get help sleeping, there is a flower strain for every occasion. Beverages (cannabis-infused drinks) \u2013 a fantastic (and low calorie) option to experience cannabis. From cannabis seltzer to cannabis hops water (it tastes like an IPA beer) to cannabis cold brew (caffeine + weed), new options are coming online every month. Edibles (gummies, chocolate, mints) \u2013 we are a long way from your homemade pot brownies! Cannabis edibles are one of the most popular cannabis product categories thanks to product variety (types of edibles and amount of cannabis in each product). Our good friends at Garden Society offer artisan-crafted cannabis-infused chocolates. Cartridges & Extracts (used for vaping cannabis) \u2013 these products are used with vape pens or products and are inhaled. There is no smoke and minimal to no smell, so if you are looking for a discreet cannabis option, vaping may be the answer. Topicals \u2013 CBD topical oils, balms and bath bombs, used for general relaxation and pain relief, are great self-care and wellness options. Cannabis in Wine Country What you need to know during your visit and when you head home Mixing Wine & Weed There's a good chance that if you're visiting Wine Country, you're going to be visiting wineries, drinking wine, and enjoying Wine Country's famous farm-to-table cuisine. So what happens if you bring weed into the mix? Alcohol is known to increase the effects of marijuana, resulting in a stronger high when used together. The important thing to remember is that everyone reacts differently. If you're new to cannabis, you may want to tread lightly with how much wine you consume beforehand. Spas, Health & Wellness + Cannabis A few of our favorite Wine Country spas offering CBD treatments include Bardessono in Yountville (Napa Valley) and Carneros Resort and Spa in Napa. Cannabis Tours & Experiences Another great \u2014 and safe \u2014 introduction to the world of weed is a cannabis tour or experience. Lead by local experts, cannabis tours are a unique way to learn and experience cannabis in different contexts. Our good friend Jared Giammona at The Sonoma Experience is one of the best around and hosts some of our favorite tours including a Wine & Cannabis tour, a Craft Beer & Cannabis tour, and a behind the scenes immersive cannabis tour. Safe Cannabis Use There are a few best practices for ensuring your cannabis experience is safe and enjoyable. New cannabis users should start with small amounts (let's say 2.5 milligrams) and opt for products with mild THC levels (the budtenders at the dispensary can help you find the best products for beginners). Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid cannabis. Pro tip: Staying hydrated will help your body process cannabis. We already talked about how driving under the influence of cannabis is illegal, and not to be a buzzkill, but it's also very dangerous. Like alcohol, cannabis can impair your ability to operate a motorized vehicle safely by affecting judgment, coordination, and reaction time. Heading Home Pro tip: It's illegal to transport marijuana purchased or obtained in California, across state lines. This applies to flying, driving, and even taking a train or bus. So, if you are visiting from out of state, it's a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d situation. The best practice is to purchase cannabis in smaller amounts if you're visiting for a short period of time. You can always get more! So, now you are in the know about all things cannabis in Wine Country.

        "title": "The Best Winery Bike Tours, Rentals & Routes in Napa Valley",
        "text": "Napa Valley 's year-round fair weather and stunning stretches of vineyard-dotted roads make it the ideal place to explore by bicycle. A great alternative to wine tasting by car, biking offers the chance to slow down, revel in the fresh Napa Valley air, and truly appreciate Wine Country's gorgeous scenery. Plus, it doesn't hurt to get a little exercise in when you're indulging in Napa's world-class wine and food scene. The majority of Napa's roads are well-paved and relatively flat, with some moderate, rolling hills that even beginner bikers can handle and enjoy, while experienced riders looking for a challenge can take to the winding back roads and mountains that hug the valley. Here's everything you need to know about cycling in Napa Valley, including where to get bike rentals or book a bike tour. Before you go Courtesy of Clif Family Winery Whether you bring your own bike or rent one, you'll want to make sure you pack the same essentials that you would to cycle anywhere: a spare tube in case of a flat tire, water, energy food, and your photo ID and a credit card, in case you want to stop somewhere along your journey. In California, only those aged 18 and under are required by law to wear a bicycle helmet, but it's still highly recommended. Napa Valley roads like Hwy 29 and the Silverado Trail are heavily trafficked by cars and on the Wine Country back roads, there are many sharp turns that can cause blindspots for drivers. Napa Valley Bike Routes Courtesy of The Napa Valley Vine Trail If you want to keep things leisurely, downtown Napa, Yountville, St. Helena, and Calistoga are all easily cruiseable and a bike will help you bop around from shops to restaurants to wine tasting rooms at your own pace. But if you do want to work up a bit of a sweat, one of the safest and easiest bike routes is The Napa Valley Vine Trail . Clocking in at 12.5 miles point-to-point, this bike route will take you from South Napa to Yountville along a nicely-paved, car-free road. Depending on which end you start cycling from, this is the perfect route for grabbing lunch at either the Oxbow Public Market or one of Yountville's many restaurants, like Bouchon Bistro , RH Yountville , or R+D Kitchen . Eventually, the vine trail will be extended all the way to Calistoga, stretching a total of 47 miles. Until then, you take the bike lane along the Silverado Trail from Napa to Calistoga (we don't necessarily recommend Hwy 29, as it's much more heavily trafficked), but most cyclists come to Napa Valley to get off-the-beaten-path and away from the wine tasting crowds. Either way, you'll find vineyard views abound. The bucolic rolling hills of the Carneros wine region in south Napa offer some of the best views \u2014 not just of vineyards, but of bright green pastures and cows, too \u2014 and can be tackled by beginning and moderate riders. Serious cyclists seeking a climb can make the trek up Mt. Veeder, a favorite of Napa locals. Located on the west side of Napa town, the highest point of this ride is 1,400 ft. The way down is fast and fun, but be aware of the occasional car coming around the corner. Another advanced option is to pedal the switch-back back roads that lead to Pope Valley. Many cyclists refer to this area as \u201cold Napa,\u201d for it's seemingly untouched by tourism. Here you can clock some real mileage, but it does require quite a bit of steep climbing. One of the most popular loops starts in St. Helena and winds back around Lake Hennessey for a total of roughly 35 miles. Bike Tours Courtesy of Getaway Adventures If you prefer a bike tour to rentals \u2014 sometimes it's nice not to have to plan and you're guaranteed not to get lost \u2014 book with Getaway Adventures , which takes you on Napa Valley's quiet, scenic, and low-traffic country lanes, with winery stops along the way. The Sip & Cycle Experience , for example, is a full-day Wine Country adventure (five-and-a-half hours long), and the tour includes stops at a few Calistoga wineries and a boxed picnic lunch. Overall, you'll get in about 12 miles and plenty of wine. If you're feeling extra adventurous, book a combo bike and kayak tour. Bike Rentals Courtesy of Clif Family Winery Many Napa Valley hotels and resorts offer bike rentals (sometimes complimentary) for guests, like Carneros Resort , Solage , and The Setting Inn . You can also walk in or get bike rentals \u2014 everything from a road bike to a cruiser to electric (E-bike) \u2014 delivered right to your accommodations from shops like Napa Valley Velo , St. Helena Cyclery , and Calistoga Bike Shop . Owned by the same people behind Clif Bar, Clif Family Winery is all about vino and velo and offers a few bike packages for varying levels and interests: the Tour de St. Helena and The White Road. So if you want to practice the art of balance on your Napa Valley visit, you can pick up a bike at the winery in the morning for a self-guided tour, return it in the afternoon, and then sit down for a delicious wine and food experience. \u2013 The Best Outdoor Experiences in Napa Valley \u2013 \u2013 9 Fantastic Napa Valley Wine Tours for Every Traveler \u2013 Author Jess Lander Jess Lander is a freelance wine, food and travel writer based in Napa Valley and exploring all things California wine country.

        "title": "8 Napa Valley Hotel Pools to Dive Into Now",
        "text": "World-class wine and delectable cuisine aside, there's much to love about a getaway to Napa Valley \u2014 especially during summer and early fall when warm weather and sunshine are aplenty. Luckily, when you need to cool off between wine tastings, the valley is home to some of the most luxurious hotel pools around. Here are eight Napa Valley hotel pools that we love, whether you're looking to lounge poolside in a cabana or float in healing thermal waters right outside your room. COVID-19 Note: Though most hotel pools throughout Napa Valley are open to guests, including the ones on this list, please check with each hotel directly to confirm pool hours, cabana availability, and general guidelines as certain amenities may be limited. A Countryside Retreat Adult pool at Carneros Resort, Courtesy of Carneros Resort and Spa Carneros Resort and Spa 4048 Sonoma Highway, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 299-4900 When you check into the picturesque Carneros Resort and Spa, you'll have not one but two pools to lounge beside during your stay. Enjoy panoramic views of farmland and grapevines at the serene adults-only pool, where private cabanas come complete with personalized service and extras like sparkling wine and appetizers. Or, make a day of it at the palm tree lined pool near the fitness center, a family-friendly outdoor swimming pool fit for an afternoon of fun. Contemporary Cool Courtesy of Bardessono Bardessono 6526 Yount Street, Yountville, CA 94599, (707) 204-6000 A sun-drenched rooftop pool is the perfect place to savor the calming atmosphere of Bardessono, a LEED Platinum-certified hotel known for its sleek contemporary architecture and commitment to green initiatives. Take in views of Yountville as you sink into your lounge chair, cocktail in hand, and let all your worries fade away. Vineyard Views Courtesy of Meritage Resort The Meritage Resort and Spa 875 Bordeaux Way, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 251-1900 Soak up the sun from The Meritage Resort's heated pool, an adults-only pool with a hot tub and seasonal poolside service. Set against a backdrop of the resort's hillside vineyard and underground spa cave, the pool makes it easy to embrace those vacation vibes year-round. Heading to the spa without a stay? The Meritage sometimes allows pool access for spa guests, based on availability. Sprawling Sophistication Courtesy of Solage Solage, An Auberge Resort & Spa 755 Silverado Trail, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 266-7531 Flanked by palm trees and chaise lounges, the sprawling 130-foot pool at Solage epitomizes Wine Country chic. There's no better place to soak up the California sun, but when you want to take advantage of the area's geothermal springs, head to the resort's Bathhouse, where mineral-rich waters will surely sooth your troubles away. The Cabana Life Courtesy of Facebook: Vista Collina Resort Vista Collina Resort 850 Bordeaux Way, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 251-3060 Napa's Vista Collina Resort has become known for its diverse amenities, but certainly one of its most popular attractions is the expansive pool featuring 10 luxury cabanas (available for full-day rentals). Stocked with flat screen TVs, lounge chairs, and mini refrigerators, plus a food and beverage credit for four guests, these airy poolside cabanas are a great place for hotel guests to enjoy a leisurely afternoon in Napa. Centrally-located Luxury Courtesy of Hotel Yountville Hotel Yountville 6462 Washington Street, Yountville, CA 94515, (707) 967-7967 While it would be easy to spend most of your time holed up in your luxury suite at the Hotel Yountville, or even taking advantage of the hotel's convenient location close to Napa's top restaurants, it'd be a shame to miss spending ample time enjoying the glimmering on-site pool. Surrounded by towering Italian cypress trees and plush chaise lounges, it's the place to be to really feel like you're on vacation. Geothermal R&R Courtesy of Calistoga Spa Hot Springs Calistoga Spa Hot Springs 1006 Washington Street, Calistoga, CA 94515, (866) 822-5772 In case the name doesn't give it away, the main draw of this Calistoga getaway is its accessibility to hot springs. The hotel features four open-air geothermal mineral pools, including a soaking pool, lap pool, whirlpool, and kid-friendly wading pool, with water temperatures that range between 80 degrees and 104 degrees. Say hello to utter relaxation. Have you checked out our sweet WineCountry Hotel Perks?

A Hillside Oasis Courtesy of Facebook: Poetry Inn Poetry Inn 6380 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 944-0646 Nestled in the hills above Napa's Silverado Trail, Poetry Inn is an intimate oasis offering spectacular views of the Napa Valley \u2014 and yes, even the outdoor pool showcases incredible vistas. Heated April through November, the pool is a peaceful place to spend a day in Wine Country, whether reading a book on a chaise lounge, catnapping in the poolside hammock, or sipping wine as the sun goes down. We have a feeling you'll be embracing the slower pace of Napa Valley in no time. \u2013 The 10 Best Napa Valley Wine Country Resorts \u2013 \u2013 Best Napa Valley Hotels for a Romantic Getaway \u2013 Author Hana-Lee Sedgwick Hana-Lee Sedgwick is a writer and editor based in Santa Barbara, California.

        "title": "Top 8 Things to Do in Calistoga",
        "text": "While Napa Valley certainly draws visitors for its world-class wineries and vineyard views, there's much more to Napa than just wine, and nowhere is this more evident than in Calistoga . Located in the northern part of the Napa Valley, Calistoga is a great place to go wine tasting, no doubt, but it's also home to some truly unique attractions, hot springs spas, local shops and eateries, and some of the most picturesque scenery in the region. When you're ready to experience all that this small town has to offer, read our guide to the top eight things to do in Calistoga. Soak in Thermal Hot Springs If there's one word that should be associated with Calistoga, it's relaxation, and thanks to the area's numerous mineral pools and spas, it's easy to make R&R a top priority when visiting. More than just a stress reliever, Calistoga's hot springs are known for their many therapeutic benefits, including easing sore muscles, relieving arthritis pain, promoting healthy circulation, and calming skin conditions, while mineral-rich mud baths and massage treatments purify toxins to leave you feeling totally blissed out. Mineral Pool at Indian Springs Resort, Courtesy of Visit Calistoga When you're ready to experience the rejuvenating benefits of the area's mineral waters, you can't beat a dip in the historic, Olympic-sized mineral pool at Indian Springs Resort . While hotel guests get free access to the pool, Indian Springs does offer day passes for a fee, available when booking a spa treatment. Luckily, many of the hotels and inns in and around Calistoga offer access to their own on-site mineral pools, including Dr. Wilkinson's Backyard Resort , Calistoga Spa Hot Springs , and Golden Haven Hot Springs Spa & Resort , making it easy to experience Calistoga's hot springs at your leisure. For the ultimate in wellness and deluxe accommodations, plan to stay at Solage . This luxurious Auberge property features a 20,000-square-foot spa with a geothermal pool, where mud therapies, mineral bath rituals, and skin treatments are inspired by the area's natural springs. The resort's 130-foot swimming pool, while not a mineral pool, makes for an exceptional place to relax post-treatment. Visit a Geyser Just a few minutes outside of town is Old Faithful Geyser , where one can witness the spectacular sight of water shooting up into the air every 30 to 40 minutes. While the main attraction is the regular eruption of this famed geyser, naturally, a visit offers a more well-rounded experience than one might expect, thanks to picnic grounds with bocce courts and cabanas, a garden area featuring native plants and grasses, an on-site geology museum, and an animal farm, where you'll find goats, sheep, and llamas. Llamas and pygmy goats and geysers, oh my! It all adds up to a memorable afternoon in Calistoga. Soar Above the Region in a Hot Air Balloon Ride It may not be the cheapest activity on this list, but we can't think of a more exhilarating way to start your morning than by soaring above Napa Valley in a hot air balloon. Calistoga Balloons , which picks up right from downtown Calistoga, offers private flights for two (at $2,200 per couple), but if you're not looking to spend the big bucks on a flight, Napa Valley Balloons offers standard balloon rides at $275 per guest. They'll even pick you up from your hotel and transport you to their launch site. Keep in mind, this adventure is for the early birds, as most rides require an arrival before sunrise, usually around 5 or 6am. Courtesy of Napa Valley Balloons Go On a Hike For Sweeping Views of the Area When the great outdoors are calling, Calistoga's Palisade Trail is the spot to go. Though the 10-mile round trip, 2,000-foot climb hike is challenging, experienced hikers will be rewarded with beautiful natural scenery and some of the most spectacular views in all of Napa Valley. Just don't forget to bring your water, as it can get hot in the sun. For a shortened version, opt to hike along the lower Oat Hill Mine Road, a four-and-a-half-mile round trip trek that provides equally wonderful scenery along the way. Explore An Ancient Forest If a unique outdoor experience with the family is what you seek, don't miss a visit to Calistoga's Petrified Forest . This preserved ancient forest is a sight to see, featuring a majestic display of fossilized redwood trees \u2014 the result of being buried in lava over 3 million years ago. Walk along the trails on your own to explore this ancient phenomenon, or opt for a guided tour for a deeper understanding of how this forest came to be. Sip & Shop in Downtown Calistoga It's easy to get wrapped up in Calistoga's natural surroundings, but it'd be a shame to not spend some time exploring downtown Calistoga. Calistoga has lots of boutique shops and tasting rooms all within walking distance, which makes it easy to sip and stroll all afternoon. Courtesy of Visit Calistoga Plan to peruse the assortment of artisanal goods for the home and garden at Blackbird , shop for antique goods and furniture at Roam Antiques , and check out Calistoga Pottery for their selection of handmade pottery. Also downtown is Copperfield's Books , featuring a wide range of books from local and international authors, Flourish Chocolate , offering one-of-a-kind chocolate creations, and Monastery Books and Gifts (yes, actually located inside a Christian Monastery for women) for a selection of spiritual books, homemade goodies, olive oils, teas, and honey. You'll also find a variety of art galleries and clothing shops around town that are worth popping into. Courtesy of Tank Garage Winery When you're ready to whet your palate with some locally made wine, Calistoga's tasting rooms offer something for everyone. Located in a vintage 1930s gas station, Tank Garage Winery charms with its hip vibe and limited-edition blends and natural wines, while nearby T-Vine Winery offers a friendly ambiance and single-vineyard wines from some of the last remaining old-vine vineyards in California. Around the corner on Lincoln Avenue, CAMi Art + Wine blends contemporary art with wine, and a few doors down, Olabisi features limited production wines from a husband-and-wife-duo. Visit a Nearby Winery You could easily stay in town to taste great wine, hopping from tasting room to tasting room, but it's certainly worth jumping in the car and driving a few miles to explore some of the surrounding wineries. Just five minutes from downtown Calistoga, Tamber Bey Vineyards is unique in that it's located at a working equestrian facility, and every part of the wine tasting experience reflects the owners' love of horses and wine. Tour the winemaking facility, which was once a covered riding arena, before sampling wine in the courtyard of the original barn, where you can sip wine while admiring the horses. Be sure to add a picnic lunch or savory cookie pairing to really round out the experience. Courtesy of Tamber Bey | Sarah Risk At Brian Arden , the best way to experience the great wine and hospitality of this super small, family-owned winery is to book the Chef's Experience Tasting . You'll not only get to tour the winery's picturesque grounds, featuring a culinary garden, chickens, and estate vineyard, but you'll also be treated to a seated wine and food pairing experience featuring five seasonally-inspired courses. Another smaller, hidden-gem winery is Canard , which only recently reopened its 25-acre property to visitors. From their sustainably-grown, dry-farmed grapes, owners Rich and Carolyn Czapleski carefully produce nine single vineyard wines to showcase the complexity of their estate's terroir. Finally, serious cabernet fans won't want to miss a visit to Larkmead Vineyards , one of the oldest family-owned wineries in Napa Valley. This tranquil winery offers a personalized tasting experience tailored to each group's preferences, along with an idyllic Wine Country setting looking out at the vines. Savor Gourmet Fare Whether you're hungry for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, Calistoga's intimate restaurants and caf\u00e9s offer a perfect mix of casual ambiance and good food. Sam's General Store, Courtesy of Sam's General Store For gourmet coffee and a scrumptious pastry or breakfast sandwich, stop by Sam's General Store , located in the original cottage of Calistoga's legendary founder, Samuel Brannan. Or, grab a selection of goods to curate your own picnic lunch later in the day. The long-standing Cafe Sarafornia is another top spot for the breakfast/lunch crowd, where a menu of comforting classics is offered all day from this quaint, casual spot. One of the most popular restaurants in town for dinner is Evangeline , a French bistro \u201cwith a Creole soul\u201d in downtown Calistoga. The covered outdoor patio makes for a lovely setting to enjoy the restaurant's French bistro classics and creole-inspired dishes. Nearby, Amaro Italian Kitchen , located in the Mount View Hotel , features Italian cuisine served alongside one of the most extensive selections of Amaro in the country. Down the road, Sam's Social Club is another worthy dining choice, where California focused-cuisine highlights fresh, local ingredients in a playful, creative way. \u2013 The 15 Best Wineries in Calistoga \u2013 \u2013 The 7 Best Hotels in Calistoga \u2013 Author Hana-Lee Sedgwick Hana-Lee Sedgwick is a writer and editor based in Santa Barbara, California.

        "title": "Napa Valley Day Trip: A Guide to One Perfect Day in Napa",
        "text": "Everyone knows California's Napa Valley has some of the best wineries in the world, but it's so much more than just wine. Napa Valley is a world-class Wine Country filled with extraordinary culinary experiences, stunning mountains and vineyards, and amazing art. It's also just a hop, skip, and a jump (or rather a short drive) from San Francisco and neighboring Sonoma, which makes it a perfect destination for a day trip. While you could easily fit in a half-day visit to Napa, we suggest making it a full-day trip, so you can do all the fun things like wine tasting, dining out, and exploring, of course. And there's no need for lots of planning because this itinerary maps out how to have a fantastic day full of some of Napa Valley's best experiences without too much time in the car. (Note: Most of the stops on the itinerary are in and around the city of Napa, as destinations further north like Yountville and St. Helena would eat up too much drive time.) COVID-19 Note: Please be sure to check with each business in advance to confirm operating details and to make a reservation. For the latest information on what's open, visit our pandemic news page. Start with a hearty breakfast Courtesy of Boon Fly Cafe Breakfast is definitely the most important meal of the day when wine tasting is on the itinerary. Proteins and carbs will help soak up that booze (or at least help it absorb it more slowly), and there's no better protein and carb combo than the chicken and waffles at Boon Fly Caf\u00e9 at the picturesque Carneros Resort and Spa . Located at 4048 Sonoma Highway (as you head into Napa from San Francisco or Sonoma), it's the perfect spot to start the day. Pro tip: Grab a dozen of the famous donuts for car snacking. Enjoy a delicious lunch at Oxbow Market Courtesy of Oxbow Public Market Oxbow Public Market , located at 610 1st Street in Napa, is popular with locals and tourists alike, and for good reason. You'll find all kinds of food purveyors at this lively high-end market, where you can enjoy a fantastic meal as well as find all kinds of epicurean delights from local Californian food and wine producers. Take a lap before committing to your lunch fare (you'll find everything from oysters to burgers to empanadas) and then enjoy your meal on the spacious deck overlooking the Napa River. You can also find plenty of goodies to assemble your own picnic, if you'd prefer to pack a picnic and eat along the Napa Riverfront. Stroll and shop in downtown Napa First Street Shopping, Courtesy of Sarah Anne Risk If you're looking for something to do other than wine tasting, look no further than First Street in downtown Napa, where you'll find three blocks of tasting rooms, interesting shops, and unique art galleries. You can also stop by the Napa Valley Welcome Center, located at 1300 1st Street, and pick up a complimentary map for the Napa Valley Art Walk , a public outdoor art exhibition featuring eight sculptures, all within walking distance of each other. Tour and taste at some of Napa's best wineries Tasting at Stags' Leap, Courtesy of Stags' Leap Winery It would be extremely ambitious to stop at every winery mentioned on this itinerary, but if you want to make a go of it, they're listed here in driving order. Better yet, pick one or two, so you can really enjoy the experience without rushing or worrying about time. Stags' Leap Winery , located at 6150 Silverado Trail in Napa, is on one of California's first wine estates \u2014 home to 240 acres of vineyards and an 1890s stone Manor House surrounded by beautiful gardens. Book the 75-minute estate tasting experience so you can explore the property and gardens before enjoying a seated tasting. William Hill Estate Winery , located at 1761 Atlas Peak Road in Napa, is another picturesque estate with views of the vineyards and rolling hills. Book the Overlook Tasting to sit on the terrace and take it all in. JaM Cellars Tasting Room, Courtesy of JaM Cellars Music meets wine at JaM Cellars' tasting room, located at 1460 1st Street in downtown Napa. Listen to some classic vinyl while enjoying a glass or flight in the welcoming and eclectic space, which is unlike anything else you'll find in Napa. Before you head back home, make one last stop at Domaine Carneros , located at 1240 Duhig Road in Napa. Stroll through the formal gardens before taking a seat on the terrace of the French-inspired Chateau, where you can sip bubbles, snack on caviar, and toast to an amazing day in Wine Country. Get a new perspective on Napa with an unusual or global-inspired dining experience Courtesy of Napa Valley Wine Train If you're \u201cjust\u201d looking for exceptional food in a stylish space that stays fixed to the ground for the entire meal, Napa has some extraordinary restaurants. Ang\u00e8le Restaurant & Bar , a riverfront bistro located at 540 Main Street in downtown Napa, will transport you to France for the evening. And dining at Morimoto Napa , located just a few doors down at 610 Main Street, feels like a trip to Japan, complete with sushi, sake, and even a little shopping. However, if you're looking for a more unusual dining experience, you can go on a literal culinary journey via land or sea. Roll past Napa's lush landscapes and travel back in time on the Napa Valley Wine Train , located at 1275 Mckinstry Street in Napa. This classic Napa experience is available for wine tours during the day, but they also offer a two-hour gourmet dinner at night. If a train doesn't float your boat, a Winemaker Cruise definitely will. Glide along the Napa River in a 50-foot yacht while enjoying a four-course dinner with wine pairings. The boat departs from the Napa Yacht Club, located at 100 Riverside Road in Napa. Everyone deserves a perfect California Wine Country experience full of amazing food, wine, and scenery. And with so many activities available for those short on time, a day trip to Napa Valley is totally doable.

        "title": "9 Places to Taste Excellent Napa Valley Chardonnay",
        "text": "When we hear that there is such a thing as the \u201cAnything But Chardonnay\u201d crowd, we scratch our heads. With so many different styles and expressions depending on where it is grown and how it is produced, we just know there is a chardonnay out there for everyone. One of the top places in the country to experience this versatile wine grape is Napa Valley . From steely, mineral-driven, cool climate bottlings, to rich, ripe white wines with tropical fruit for days, chardonnay lives up to its potential in the hands of the talented winemakers of the region. We've compiled a list of some of our favorite places in Napa Valley to sip chardonnay. We promise even the strictest of the ABC devotees are sure to find something they like in this lineup. Courtesy of Grgich Hills Estate Grgich Hills Estate 1829 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 963-2784 The mastermind behind the wine that won the 1976 Paris Tasting for Chateau Montelena, Mike Grgich, ultimately opened this Rutherford winery in 1977. Natural wine enthusiasts will love Grgich's commitment to sustainability, as they farm their estate vineyards without the use of artificial fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides, and rely on wild yeast fermentation in the winery. The result? A portfolio of wines that are elegant and expressive, including three different chardonnays, each offering a distinct take on the versatile grape. Insider Tip: From August through November, visitors are invited to become winemaker for a day as they stomp a barrel of freshly-picked grapes in celebration of harvest, and then commemorate the occasion by leaving their grape-stained footprints on a white souvenir t-shirt. Courtesy of Goosecross Cellars Goosecross Cellars 1119 State Lane, Yountville, CA 94599, (707) 944-1986 This family-owned and operated winery in Yountville is known for its dedicated hospitality, welcoming atmosphere, and world-class wines. Guests are invited to take to the scenic deck to sip expertly crafted wines found only at the winery, including the Burgundian-style Napa Valley Chardonnay, made from Dijon clone fruit from the winery's Corrotto Vineyard on the Napa side of Carneros. Insider Tip: Members of the three-tiered wine club enjoy complimentary tastings on the \u201cClub Patio,\u201d in addition to a host of other perks, making it a must for fans of Goosecross' small-production, winery-only portfolio. Courtesy of William Hill Estate Winery William Hill Estate Winery 1761 Atlas Peak Road, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 265-3024 Nestled at the foot of Atlas Peak, on the Silverado Bench, William Hill Estate Winery produces wines from chardonnay and Bordeaux varieties from hidden gem vineyards of California's most celebrated regions. Established in 1976, William Hill has been crafting chardonnay that showcases the distinctive characteristics of their vineyards as well as the limitless expressions of this grape, from bright and clean with mouthwatering acidity, to sumptuous and buttery with oak and tropical fruit aromas. Insider Tip: Book the Arbor Picnic Basket pairing and sip four wines carefully paired with a selection of culinary delights like salmon rillette, toffee made from William Hill chardonnay, and locally crafted salami. Courtesy of Far Niente Far Niente 1350 Acacia Drive, Oakville, CA 94562, (707) 944-2861 Celebrated for its reputation for outstanding cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay wines, this Oakville winery was established in 1885, when the words \u201cFar Niente,\u201d idiomatically translated to \u201cwithout a care,\u201d were carved into the original stone building. While the phrase certainly captures how one feels sipping expertly crafted chardonnay at this idyllic property, it in no way reflects the winery's attention to quality and detail when it comes to winemaking. Insider Tip: Experience the effects that Coombsville vineyards and volcanic ash soils have on the chardonnay grape as you sip on current and rare, library vintages of the estate-bottled Napa Valley and Cave Collection chardonnays, as well as the winery's cabernet sauvignon, during the Cave Collection Library Wine Tasting. Courtesy of Flora Springs Flora Springs 677 St. Helena Highway, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 967-8032 While officially founded in 1978, grapes were first planted on this St. Helena property, located at the foot of the Mayacamas, in the late 1800s, which marked the start of Flora Springs' fascinating history. The winery produces several different chardonnays, each with a unique flavor profile, from the juicy and tropical Family Select Chardonnay to the limited-production Flora's Legacy Chardonnay, made from a barrel selection of the finest chardonnay of the vintage, in honor of Flora Komes, the inspiration for the winery. Insider Tip: Flora Springs feels so strongly about the quality of their chardonnay and other white wines that the winery has been a leading proponent of the movement to introduce the #whitewineemoji. Courtesy of Beaulieu Vineyard Beaulieu Vineyard 1960 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 257-5749 With over a century of winemaking in the region, Beaulieu Vineyard (\u201cBV\u201d for short) has long been known as an iconic producer of Napa Valley wines. While cabernet is the grape the winery is most known for (BV produced one of the earliest \u201ccult\u201d cabernets in the region), BV crafts several different varietal wines and blends worth noting. In fact, it was one the first producers in the area to start making distinctive chardonnay from Carneros. Today, BV crafts single vineyard chardonnays as well as appellated blends, each revealing classic varietal character and diversity of terroir. Insider Tip: Because of the winery's history in crafting exceptional cabernet wines, most of the tasting experiences offered are focused on cabernets. To shift your attention to chardonnay, it's best to reach out to the winery directly to ask about a customized tasting experience for your group, or even a virtual tasting experience, which you can do from the comfort of your home.

        "title": "Your Guide to Napa Valley on a Budget",
        "text": "Although Napa Valley has become increasingly synonymous with elevated (often costly) experiences, there are still plenty of ways to make the most of the area without spending a fortune. Our guide to experiencing Napa Valley on a budget includes some of the most charming destinations and activities for the budget-minded traveler, so whether you're coming up from San Francisco for the day or flying in for a week long stay, you can go easy on the wallet without sacrificing the fun. What to Do Eat & Explore in Downtown Napa Situated along the Napa River, downtown Napa is an extremely walkable destination filled with plenty of things to do on the cheap. We suggest heading to First Street Napa to peruse the many boutiques (yes, window shopping is allowed), then taking a leisurely stroll around town. Be sure to check out the sculptures along the Napa Art Walk as you wander the streets. This (free) urban exhibition of public artworks highlights the work of various artists throughout the West Coast. Grab a map at the Napa Valley Welcome Center, where you can also get more information on deals in the area, such as two-for-one tastings. Explorers at heart won't want to miss the Napa Scavenger Hunt Walking Tour .\u00a0 It's a self-guided walking tour and game you play by following clues provided on your smartphone.\u00a0 Follow the clues, find interesting sights and solve fun puzzles and challenges along the tour.\u00a0 Use coupon code NAPA10 to save 10%! When hunger strikes, Napa has plenty of options where one can eat well while minding the budget. Don't miss the Oxbow Public Market , a collection of artisan restaurants and shops in Napa, which offers something for every taste. For the budget-conscious, we love the breakfast items at Model Bakery, most of which are under $10, and you simply can't beat a $12 lunch of a hamburger and fries from Gott's. You can also find a variety of tasty tacos under $10 at C Casa, or even pick up a few cheeses from the Oxbow Cheese and Wine Merchant to pack for an afternoon picnic in the vineyards. Oxbow Cheese and Wine Merchant, Courtesy of Oxbow Public Market If you've indulged in some wine tasting at any of Napa's urban tasting rooms (such as JaM Cellars or Mayacamas ), we wouldn't blame you if a grilled cheese is calling your name. In such a circumstance, check out Melted , a downtown sandwich shop specializing in ooey gooey grilled cheese sandwiches \u2014 most of which are priced under $12. Nearby, Bounty Hunter offers happy hour specials Monday through Friday, featuring such deals as a $14 BBQ sampler plate and $7 wines by the glass. If you're hungry for more budget-conscious food ideas, check out one of Napa's food trucks . Offering everything from burgers and sandwiches to tacos and hot dogs, if you spot one while cruising around town, your taste buds (and your wallet) will surely thank you. Go Wine Tasting Though it will cost you a little bit upfront, Bay Area locals and those who visit Napa Valley often may want to consider purchasing a Covet Pass wine tasting pass. You'll get complimentary tastings at a handful of Napa wineries (plus tastings in Sonoma County and Lake County!), which, at $150 per pass, is a great deal considering the regular wine tasting fees at these wineries will run you $30 \u2013 $50+ per person. It's a fantastic way to save while you sip. Not surprisingly, free wine tastings aren't really a thing in Napa Valley (without some sort of wine pass, that is). There are, however, a few affordable wine tasting deals to be enjoyed in Wine Country, if you know where to look. For tastings of quality wine priced at $25 or less per person, check out Bennett Lane , a Calistoga winery known for their friendly service and highly rated blends, as well as Dutch Henry , a family-owned winery located along the picturesque Silverado Trail. In downtown Yountville, head to the charming tasting room and art gallery of Jessup Cellars , where a tasting of three wines will only set you back $20. Also worth trying is the family-owned Trefethen . Though a tasting will cost you $30 per person, the quality of the experience and their estate-grown wines make it feel like you're getting a lot of bang for your buck. Courtesy of Beringer Vineyards At the historic Beringer Vineyards in St. Helena, wine tastings start at $35 per person, but those simply looking for a glass of wine can take advantage of the weekend-only \u201cstroll and sip\u201d experience. Though not seated, this $15 offering allows you to walk around the beautiful gardens of this iconic 144-year-old estate, glass of wine in hand. By the glass offerings are also available at Clos Pegase winery in Calistoga, where glasses of wine start at $10 and can be sipped al fresco with views of the expansive estate and vineyards. Budget-Friendly Insider Tip: For those flying out of the Sonoma County Airport (STS), San Francisco Int'l Airport (SFO), or Sacramento Int'l Airport (SMF) on Alaska Airlines, be sure to take advantage of their \u201cWine Flies Free\u201d program. It's an easy way to transport your wine purchases back home \u2014 all you need to do is pack your wine in a case box before heading to the airport. Get Outdoors With scenic vistas, lush forests, and rolling hills of vineyards, not to mention mild weather year-round, Napa Valley is a great place to spend some time outdoors. And luckily for those on a budget, many outdoor activities can be enjoyed at little to no cost. Bothe-Napa Valley State Park, Courtesy of Visit Calistoga Napa Valley is home to a variety of parks with picnic facilities and hiking trails, most of which are free to use. Located just outside of St. Helena, Bothe-Napa Valley State Park offers hiking trails that wind through coastal redwoods and madrones, as well as picnic facilities under towering Douglas Firs. On the other side of the valley, near Rutherford, Moore Creek Park offers multi-use trails worth exploring \u2014 great for hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian use. It's also a good place to spot some wildlife, as large mammals in the park are plentiful. Close to downtown Napa, Alston Park is a popular park for dog owners to roam, thanks to an off-leash dog area, but there's also an easy 2.7-mile trail loop that beckons with beautiful wildflowers along the way. Also worth exploring is Calistoga's Petrified Forest , a preserved ancient forest of fossilized redwood trees. Walk along the trails to explore this unique outdoor exhibition as you learn more about the excavation of the trees and the petrification process. Admission is $12 per adult, $6 per child (though kids under 6 are free). For a leisurely outdoor experience on two wheels, take advantage of hourly hybrid bike rentals (which will run you about $15 per hour or $40 \u2013 $45 per day) from places like St. Helena Cyclery or Enjoy Napa Valley . Spend the day biking along the 12.5-mile car-free bike path known as the Vine Trail or plan to venture along the scenic Silverado Trail, home to many of Napa's most famous wineries. Where to Stay Luxury resorts and well-appointed boutique hotels abound in Napa Valley, but they often come with a hefty price tag. Luckily, when you need a comfortable place to stay that won't eat up the bulk of your vacation budget, regardless of whether you're visiting in summer or in the off-season, there are a few good options to consider. The historic Calistoga Inn, Restaurant and Brewery in Calistoga features 17 clean and comfortable second-floor rooms, each outfitted with a queen bed and private sink. Guest rooms share common restrooms and shower facilities down the hall, which contributes to the Inn's affordability, but the convenient location in the heart of town more than makes up for it. Plus, you'll be steps from the Inn's own restaurant and brewery, complete with expansive patio and regular live music. Calistoga Inn, Restaurant & Brewery, Courtesy of Calistoga Inn Nearby in Calistoga, UpValley Inn & Hot Springs is an easy place to escape to without breaking the bank. Offering rustic, yet modern decor, a sauna and steam room, plus its own natural mineral hot springs pool and hot tub, you'll be feeling the R&R vibes for a lot less than other Calistoga hot springs resorts. In Napa, the Best Western PLUS Inn at the Vines offers great value in a convenient location just a five-minute drive south of downtown Napa. The furnishings are classic and comfortable, while amenities such as an outdoor pool, on-site restaurant, and gym add to its appeal. For something a bit more deluxe in Napa, check out the Silverado Resort and Spa . Though not technically a \u201cbudget\u201d accommodation, the resort's numerous amenities, including golf, tennis, a spa, and on-site dining, make a stay feel like a true vacation, while reasonably priced rooms make it a more accessible destination than other resorts in Wine Country. Budget-Friendly Insider Tip: Want to stay at the Silverado Resort for less? Use our special promo link and you'll get 25% off the best available room rate and a $50 resort credit. And be sure to check out all of our Napa Valley lodging deals for discounted rates and special perks like complimentary bottles of wine and spa credits. Other Tips For the Budget-Conscious It may sound obvious, but planning your trip to Napa in the off-season months or even mid-week during high season can usually help you cut costs. Not only do hotels tend to offer better rates, but restaurants will generally be less crowded, so you'll up your chances of snagging a spot during the coveted happy hour. It'd be a shame to come to Napa Valley and not enjoy a great bottle of wine with a good meal. While many restaurants pride themselves on their fantastic wine lists (and for good reason), we realize that not everyone can afford to splurge on wine and food in one sitting. Good news for those on a budget: many Napa restaurants will allow you to bring your own bottle and pay a corkage fee. Of course, corkage fees and regulations vary by restaurant, so be sure to check with each restaurant in advance. Lastly, many Napa Valley wineries offer picnic facilities on-site to enjoy during a tasting or with the purchase of a bottle of wine. While some wineries have picnic provisions available for purchase, others will actually allow you to bring your own food, such as Napa Cellars . Due to COVID-19, bringing your own picnic may be restricted, but it's definitely worth looking into as a picnic among the vineyards is a great way to experience Wine Country. Courtesy of Bob McClenahan Photography While Napa lures with luxe hotels and high-end experiences, it's not necessary to spend a fortune to have a wonderful experience. There are plenty of authentic and budget-friendly experiences waiting to be had in Wine Country, and with a little planning and creativity, a visit to Napa Valley on a budget just may lead to the most memorable vacation yet. \u2013 Things to do in Downtown Napa: A Traveler's Guide \u2013 \u2013 8 Must-Stay Hotels in Napa \u2013 Author Hana-Lee Sedgwick Hana-Lee Sedgwick is a writer and editor based in Santa Barbara, California.

        "title": "The Best Time of the Year to Visit Napa Valley",
        "text": "Regardless of when you plan to visit, be it next weekend or next fall, Napa Valley is always a good idea. After all, there's a reason why Napa remains one of the most visited regions in California, and, believe it or not, wine is only part of the equation. Napa Valley truly offers something for everyone, thanks to its world-class wineries, stunning scenery, luxe accommodations, Michelin-starred restaurants, restorative spas, arts and culture, unique shopping, and\u2026 well, we could go on and on. However, it's not just the endless array of activities that draws visitors, it's also the good weather. Napa enjoys a mild, Mediterranean climate with plenty of sunny days throughout the year, making this Northern California wine region not only well-suited for growing grapes, but an ideal destination for visitors any time of year. The best time of year to visit Napa Valley really depends on the type of experience you want to enjoy, as every season offers a different slice of Wine Country life. To help you plan the perfect getaway, regardless of the time of year, we've put together a seasonal guide to visiting Napa Valley. Spring Courtesy of Facebook: Round Pond Estate After the winter rains, spring is a rejuvenating time of year in Napa Valley, when wildflowers adorn the vibrant green hillsides, vineyards start to awaken with the start of bud break, and the overall vibe is relaxed and cheerful as the days get longer. While you still may see some rain in the forecast, most of the time the temperatures are mild and inviting, making wine tasting outdoors a more appealing prospect. It's also a great time to explore Napa by biking or hiking around before the summertime heat descends upon the valley. Average highs tend to range in the mid-to-high 60s and start to roll into the mid-70s by May, though evening lows are still pretty chilly, typically in the mid-to-high 40s. Our Favorite Spring Activities in Napa Valley: Sip wine and admire the extensive art collection adorning the beautiful grounds of HALL St. Helena Savor the sights of Napa on two wheels with a guided bike tour through Getaway Adventures Tour the culinary garden and olive groves of Round Pond Winery before sitting down for a gourmet lunch on the picturesque terrace Treat yourself to a relaxing spa treatment at one of Napa Valley's rejuvenating spas Summer Courtesy of Bob McClenahan Photography With dry, sunny days and virtually no rain \u2014 there's rarely a cloud in the sky from sunrise to sunset \u2014 it's no wonder why people flock to Napa Valley during the summer months. Wineries and tasting rooms embrace the nice weather by offering outdoor tastings and vineyard tours, hotel pools can be found bustling with happy guests enjoying the California sunshine, and local farmers' markets are bursting with summer produce. You'll find average daytime temperatures in the mid-80s to mid-90s, depending on how far north you are in the valley, with lows ranging in the 50s at night. Our Favorite Summer Activities in Napa Valley: Enjoy a private wine tasting and picnic experience in your own cabana at Louis M. Martini Winery Lounge poolside in the sun at one of Napa's many impressive hotel pools Soar high above the valley with a hot air balloon ride via Napa Valley Aloft Savor a gourmet picnic on the sprawling lawn of Vista Collina Resort , or pack your own picnic for an afternoon at Napa Cellars Fall Courtesy of Bob McClenahan Photography Fall is always a busy time of year in Wine Country, when the bustling harvest season brings an air of excitement to the valley. During the months of August, September, and October, winery teams can be seen picking grapes in the vineyards for crush, and some wineries even offer special harvest tours so you can witness the winery production facilities in action. Even if you're not here for the wine, it's hard to deny the appeal of fall in Napa, when the region shines with vibrant autumnal colors of orange, red, gold, and yellow. Add in mild temperatures both day and night and it's no wonder why harvest is a popular time for visitors (since things fill up quickly, we suggest booking hotel, restaurant, and wine tasting reservations in advance). Average daytime highs linger in the high 70s to low 80s, dropping down into the 50s at night, with rarely much precipitation in sight. Our Favorite Fall Activities in Napa Valley: Enjoy a five-course wine and food experience in Calistoga at Brian Arden Winery Experience the healing benefits of Calistoga's hot springs during a stay at the Calistoga Spa Hot Springs Winter Holiday Season Courtesy of Unsplash | Jason Leung Mid-November through early January is no doubt a magical time in Napa Valley, when festive winter events and holiday gatherings add to the joy of the season. Starting with Thanksgiving, many restaurants in the area offer special holiday dinners to take advantage of, while wineries host a range of holiday open-houses and offer specials on wine. Even whole towns go all out this time of year, showcasing bright twinkly lights and activities for kids of all ages. Daytime averages are usually in the high 50s to low 60s, with nighttime temps clocking in around the 40s and high 30s. While you may not be in for a \u201cwhite Christmas,\u201d as it doesn't snow in this region, rainy days are more frequent, so don't forget an umbrella or a rain jacket for those days when the weather forecast calls for rain instead of sun. Our Favorite Holiday Activities in Napa Valley: Find holiday gifts for all the chefs and hosts in your life with a stop into The Culinary Institute's Spice Island Marketplace Stay at one of the many amazing hotels in Yountville to take advantage of the annual Holidays in Yountville celebration (and, of course, the Michellin-starred restaurants ) Hop aboard an open-air trolley for a holiday light tour with Napa Valley Wine Trolley Prep for all that holiday entertaining by taking a hands-on cooking class at the CIA Copia Low Season Courtesy of Visit Calistoga It may be considered the rainy season in Napa, but don't let that deter you. The months of January, February, and March still offer much to love, thanks to plenty of clear, sunny days, daytime highs in the 50s, and fewer crowds than other times of year. It's also a good time to take advantage of off-season hotel rates, which can often make an escape to Napa much easier on the budget. Of course, with evening temps dropping down into the 30s in some parts of Napa Valley, you'll want to bring warm clothes, and preferably find a place to get cozy next to a fire. Our Favorite Off-Season Activities in Napa Valley: Experience the captivating beauty of Napa County's mustard fields during mustard flower season Explore Napa's historic wineries without worrying about crowds Indulge in a pampered stay at one of Napa Valley's most luxurious hotels Visit the wineries of Calistoga and Napa's Up Valley via the Calistoga Winter in the Wineries Passport Need more info to help you plan an idyllic Wine Country getaway?

        "title": "Napa Valley Reopening: What to Expect in the Covid-19 Era",
        "text": "Updated June 15, 2021 Good news! Napa Valley is open again! As of June 15, Napa is fully open. Wineries, restaurants, shopping malls, movie theaters, and most everyday places are operating as normal \u2013 with no capacity limits or physical distancing required. However, everyone is still required to follow masking guidelines in select settings. Please visit our pandemic news page for further information. Disclaimer: Please note this blog post is outdated, as California has lifted all restrictions. It's still a good idea to contact businesses before visiting, though, to confirm hours and reservation guidelines. In General Courtesy of Anastasiia Chepinska | Unsplash No Symptoms Allowed It goes without saying, but if you expect businesses to follow the necessary health and safety protocols, you are required to exercise the same precaution. If you're showing any signs of coronavirus whatsoever, you will be turned away. Masks Required Face coverings are required when inside any public place or business, as well as outdoors when social distancing isn't possible. This applies to restaurants and wineries, but once seated you'll be able to remove your mask to sip or eat normally. Physical Distancing is Mandatory Whenever you're in a public place, maintaining a distance of at least six feet from other people outside your party is required. Expect Reduced Interactions Less contact with servers and tasting room hosts has become the norm. Don't be surprised to find hand-held menus replaced by those posted on a chalkboard and other measures like contactless ordering from your phone, which limit interactions between customers and servers. Many Napa wineries and restaurants have implemented contactless payment systems for tastings, food purchases, and bottles to-go. Be Patient & Stay Flexible The Covid-19 environment is constantly evolvoing, so it's best to be patient and flexible when it comes to venturing out and about in Napa Valley. Businesses are operating under new processes and guidelines, so please pay attention to and heed all protocols. What to Expect at Wineries Courtesy of Bob McClenahan Photography Tastings by Appointment While some Napa Valley wineries have used an appointment-only model for years, you can now expect to make a reservation in advance. This helps the wineries monitor customer flow to ensure they're operating at a reduced capacity for safety reasons. Small Groups Only Time to book that long-awaited party bus with your friends? You may want to hold off for now. Wineries will be restricting group sizes, so check with each winery on group limitations when booking. Socially Distant Wine Tasting Crowded tasting rooms with standing-room only bars are a thing of the past. Tastings now take place in personal tasting areas away from other groups. What to Expect at Restaurants Courtesy of Jay Wennington | Unsplash Indoor vs Outdoor Dining Restaurants in Napa Valley are currently allowed to offer both indoor and outdoor service, as well as takeout and delivery. Indoor in-person dining is limited to 50% capacity. Reduced Occupancy Limited seating, more space between tables, and increased sanitation between guests may result in longer wait times, so even if you've made a reservation, it's best to be patient when dining out. And just be appreciative that you're not cooking dinner at home yet again! Limited Group Size Existing guidelines suggest limiting group sizes. Check with each dining establishment in advance to confirm size restrictions. What to Expect at Hotels SENZA King Room, Courtesy of SENZA Health and Safety Guidelines Will Be Communicated All Napa Valley lodging establishments are sharing their health and safety protocols on their websites, so you know what to expect before making a reservation. Flexible Cancellation Most Napa Valley hotels and resorts are offering flexible cancellation policies to make future travel planning easier despite COVID restrictions. Streamlined Check-in and Check-out Many hotels have implemented new processes for checking in and out to minimize person-to-person interactions. Increased Sanitation of all Public Places Hotels have implemented rigid sanitation procedures that include increased sanitation of all public spaces, such as front desk check-in counters, lobby seating areas, elevators, door handles, public bathrooms, room keys, gym equipment, and dining surfaces. Limited Use of Amenities Though you can still expect the same great hospitality from Napa hotels, note that the way some amenities and facilities operate may have changed. Many hotels have also implemented systems for using hotel amenities to allow for social distancing, such as reserving pool lounge chairs in advance or limited tee times. We recognize that Covid-19 is a serious health concern that impacts all of us, and when the time comes, the decision to travel to Napa Valley is ultimately your choice \u2014 and one we support either way. \u2013 Napa Valley Restaurants Reopen For Dine-In Service \u2013 \u2013 Napa Valley Businesses: Who is Open and Closed \u2013 Author WineCountry Staff LOVE THIS CONTENT?

        "title": "Beyond Cabernet Sauvignon: The Other Napa Valley Red Wines",
        "text": "When we think of Napa Valley wine, the first grape, without fail, that comes to mind is\u2026 you guessed it: cabernet sauvignon. Napa Valley has indeed earned a reputation for producing some of the world's finest cabernet sauvignon. However, the region is home to a whole world of other wine grapes that make equally interesting and delicious red wines, on their own or in a blend. We've compiled a list of some great Napa Valley wines that aren't cabernet sauvignon to consider, but don't feel limited by the selections here. There are plenty of other non-cabernet reds worth exploring, so get sipping. Zinfandel Zinfandel made a name for itself in the early 1970s during a stuck fermentation at Sutter Home Winery, resulting in the sweet style we all know as \u201cwhite zinfandel.\u201d However, the grape actually has a long history. Known as \u201cAmerica's Heritage Grape,\u201d with a genetic link to Croatia's tribidrag and Italy's primitivo, it is capable of producing a range of wines from pink and sweet, to rich and jammy, to earthy and structured, and everything in between. According to UC Davis, while cabernet sauvignon has claimed its synonymity with Napa Valley winemaking, zinfandel is in fact the only important vitis vinifera grape variety identified closely with the state of California. Wines to try Brown Estate Howell Mountain Zinfandel , Howell Mountain, Napa Valley, $60 Cabernet Franc Cabernet sauvignon wouldn't even exist without one half of its parentage \u2013 cabernet franc, who canoodled with sauvignon blanc to produce the king of Napa grapes. Much like the parent of a famous child actor, cabernet franc is deserving of recognition in its own right. Cabernet franc is most associated with adding structure and aroma to Bordeaux, and producing light-bodied, \u201ccrushable\u201d red wines from France's Loire Valley. However, in Napa Valley, its wines can be as robust and heady as its offspring, so be sure to give it a second look as an often more reasonably priced alternative to cabernet sauvignon. Wines to try Foundry Stagecoach Vineyards Cabernet Franc , Napa Valley, $110 Peju Winery Persephone Cabernet Franc , Napa Valley, $85 Merlot Being in the Sideways \u201cI am NOT drinking any [expletive] merlot!\u201d crowd is so 2004. It's time to give this grape another serious look because it's capable of producing some of the most lush, softly textured red wines out there. If you tend to shy away from the grippy tannins of a cabernet sauvignon, you will delight in the velvety palate of a beautiful merlot, which provides a superb backdrop for a wide range of dishes, from rich winter stews, to burgers and veggies on the grill on a hot summer afternoon. Wines to try Charles Krug Winery Napa Valley Merlot , Napa Valley, $25 Theorem Vineyards Diamond Mountain Estate Merlot , Diamond Mountain, Napa Valley, $90 The Petits These grapes may have the French word for \u201csmall\u201d in their names, but they are by no means diminutive in flavor or body. Petit verdot has long played a supporting role in traditional Bordeaux bottlings, contributing color, spice, and tannin to the blend. However, California winemakers are realizing that it is capable of producing brooding, inky red wines with notes of plum, black fruits, violet, and spice all on its own. Ditto for the small, thick-skinned petite sirah \u2013 not to be confused with syrah; it's actually a totally different variety also known as durif \u2013 that yields richly flavored, chocolatey red wines with high acid and high tannin. Wines to try 2017 Ehlers Estate Petit Verdot , St. Helena, Napa Valley, $65 Goosecross Cellars Petit Petite , Napa Valley, $95 Pinot Noir Ah, the fickle, fussy, frustrating pinot noir grape most famous for being the wine grape, along with chardonnay, of France's celebrated region of Burgundy\u2026 and for its starring role as the anti-merlot wine in the movie Sideways. Being a thin-skinned, early-ripening grape, pinot noir tends to thrive in cooler climates, which makes it ideal for the coastal AVA of Carneros (a region that, like Burgundy, is also known for chardonnay), which spans both Sonoma and Napa counties. These wines are elegant and intoxicatingly perfumed, making them wonderfully food-friendly or captivating enough to sip on their own. Wines to try Sean W. McBride Winery Kim Giles Vineyard Pinot Noir , Carneros, Napa Valley, $50 Tulocay Winery Coombsville Pinot Noir , Coombsville, Napa Valley, $35 Syrah Like many of the grapes listed here, syrah is widely associated with another French wine region \u2013 France's Northern Rh\u00f4ne Valley, where it is characterized by its signature peppery note. However, syrah (or shiraz as it's known in Australia, where it is also famous), is a remarkably diverse variety that, like most grapes, takes on distinct characteristics depending on where it's grown and how it's produced. Napa Valley syrah can range from earthy and peppery, like its French counterpart, to more fruit-forward, with notes of blackberry, black licorice, and anise, like an Aussie shiraz. Wines to try Bennett Lane Winery Syrah , Atlas Peak, Napa Valley, $62 Keenan Winery Syrah , Coombsville, Napa Valley, $42 Malbec Another component in the classic Bordeaux blend, as well as Argentina's hallmark grape variety, malbec has seen a steady increase in plantings in California over the past few years, and many California winemakers use it to make their Meritage (a wine blend made up of Bordeaux's \u201cnoble\u201d varieties, like cabernet sauvignon and merlot). Malbec is a sun-loving grape, so California is the perfect home for it. In Napa, it produces intensely hued, full-bodied wines with moderate acidity and tannins, and lots of plum, blackberry, and spice. Wines to try Mt. Brave Malbec , Mt. Veeder, Napa Valley, $80 James Cole Estate Winery Oak Knoll District Malbec , Oak Knoll, Napa Valley, $75 The Underdogs Feeling adventurous? There are dozens of different grape varieties that thrive in Napa Valley, so don't be afraid to explore the ones you don't see very often, or can't easily pronounce. Some of our favorites include Italian superstars like sangiovese, barbera, and nebbiolo, as well as other Spanish and Rh\u00f4ne varieties like tempranillo, grenache, and carignan. There's also an entire world of offbeat and traditional red blends out there \u2013 some featuring a small percentage of cabernet sauvignon, if you need a little bit of familiarity with your obscure varieties. There are endless permutations and combinations of different ways grapes can work together to create exciting and unique wines, so don't be afraid to get out of your comfort zone to experience the creativity of Napa's most talented mad scientist winemakers.

        "text": "Valentine's Day is right around the corner and what better place to put a little love in your heart than in Wine Country? From romantic resorts to adventures that will set hearts aflutter to fantastic wine and food that will awake the senses, Napa Valley is the perfect spot to write your own love story. Of course, Cupid isn't out in full force right now due to COVID-19, which definitely puts a damper on stolen kisses thanks to constant mask-wearing, but love birds can still find magic in this enchanting Northern California region; it just involves a little flexibility with the existing guidelines. (More on that below). Even if you don't plan that big Napa rendezvous with your Valentine this month, you can still use this guide to plan another romantic getaway, whatever time of year, because Napa Valley's weather makes it easy to visit each and every month. After all, after waiting patiently to visit Napa Valley again, you'll certainly deserve it. COVID-19 Note: Napa Valley is again welcoming visitors! Please note that existing regulations limit some activities, like wine tasting and in-person dining, to outdoors only. Be sure to confirm hours and guidelines with each of these businesses before visiting, and check out our pandemic news page for further information. Where to Stay Carneros Resort and Spa Courtesy of Carneros Resort and Spa A stay at this luxurious resort in the heart of Wine Country should come with a warning: You'll find it almost impossible to pull yourself away from the picturesque estate, which for a romantic weekend is perhaps actually perfect. Truly, there's no need to leave as the resort has everything one could possibly want: charming secluded cottages with private front porches and backyard gardens, fire pits and fireplaces, and outdoor soaking tubs; two pools with hot tubs (one which sits atop a hill with vineyard views and is adults-only); a full-service spa exclusive to guests; and three farm-to-table dining experiences. If you do manage to venture away from the grounds, you'll find plenty of world-renowned wineries nearby, as well as outdoor activities, like golf, horseback riding, hiking, and kayaking. But if you decide to enjoy breakfast in bed before making your way to a chaise lounge for the day (interrupted only by your couples massage), no one will judge you. WineCountry Perks : Book using code \u2018WINECOUNTRY' to receive a complimentary bottle of wine and $100 spa credit to use at the Spa at Carneros. 4048 Sonoma Highway, Napa, CA 94559, (866) 860-2328 Poetry Inn Courtesy of Poetry Inn Romance is the name of the game at this hillside escape, perched above the Silverado Trail in Napa's Stags Leap District.

Getaway Adventures has something for everyone, including tours where you'll bike and wine taste in the morning and kayak in the afternoon, sip and cycle through Calistoga, or hike through the hills and valleys of Napa Valley. If you'd prefer to cruise around at your own speed, you can also rent a hybrid, e-bike, or road bike and enjoy the feel of the wind in your hair as you hit the open road. 61 Front Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448, (800) 499-2453 Napa Valley Aloft Courtesy of Napa Valley Aloft Soar to new heights in your relationship (literally and metaphorically) during a hot air balloon ride over Yountville. Napa Valley Aloft balloon rides fly above the valley floor with panoramic views of Mt. St. Helena, the Mayacamas Mountains, and, if the weather cooperates, glimpses of the San Francisco skyline and the Sierras. After you safely land, you'll enjoy a post-flight Champagne brunch where you can toast to more adventures to come. Most flights have around 8 to 12 passengers, but if you're celebrating a special occasion and want to splurge, you can reserve a basket built for two. 6525 Washington Street, Yountville, CA 94599, (707) 944-4400 Where to Eat Press Napa Valley Courtesy of Press If the way to your loved one's heart is through their stomach, then don't miss dining at Press, known for its award-winning (and extensive) wine list and its selection of Prime beef, free-range poultry, local lamb, and fresh local seafood, all cooked on a custom-built, wood-fired grill. Everything about this fine dining experience is utterly enjoyable, from the food to the moody, romantic ambiance, and makes for the perfect date night out. 587 St. Helena Highway, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 967-0550 Ang\u00e8le Restaurant & Bar Courtesy of Facebook: Ang\u00e8le Restaurant & Bar Transport yourselves to France while sitting in an old boathouse on the Napa River. Ang\u00e8le is a charming restaurant in downtown Napa that has become a staple for locals and tourists alike. Enjoy wine and oysters on the heated patio overlooking the water or, on colder nights, tuck into some French onion soup or crispy duck confit in the rustic and cozy dining room. 540 Main Street, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 252-8115 Where to Taste Wine Stags' Leap Winery Courtesy of Stags' Leap Winery There's just something extra romantic about sipping wine with your loved one at a historic winery in Napa, especially if said winery offers nostalgic details, sensory gardens, fruit trees, and sweeping views. Constructed in 1890, the Manor House on the estate is the ultimate place for Cupid's arrow to strike. With its original stonework, English Renaissance style, and romantic history as a summer retreat for one-time owners, the Chase family, this picturesque building makes for an idyllic place to sample a mixture of the winery's current release and library wines. 6150 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 257-5790 HALL Winery Courtesy of HALL HALL Winery in St. Helena pairs world-class wine with intriguing art for an experience unlike any others you'll find in Wine Country.

You can wander the grounds alone and steal kisses in the Olive Grove, but if you'd like a more in-depth look at the wine and the art, reserve the Wine and Art Exploration experience where you'll be guided through the collection while sipping on some of HALL's best wines. 401 St. Helena Highway South, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 967-2626 \u2013 Best Napa Valley Hotels for a Romantic Getaway \u2013 \u2013 New in Napa 2021: Where to Sip, Savor, Stay & Shop \u2013 Author Daisy Barringer Daisy Barringer is a freelance writer who grew up in San Francisco and now lives there with her 150-pound Saint Bernard, Monkey.

        "title": "New in Napa Valley 2021: Where to Sip, Savor, Stay, and Shop",
        "text": "After a challenging 2020 that included not only a pandemic, but several devastating wildfires, Napa Valley should be at the top of your list for 2021 travel. In spite of the hardships, plenty of exciting new businesses \u2014 from restaurants and hotels to wineries and boutique shops \u2014 opened their doors recently to further diversify Napa's world-class offerings in all things wine, food, and R&R. While this Wine Country destination is unfortunately kicking off the new year under lockdown due to Covid-19, Napa Valley is expected to safely reopen to visitors by mid-to-late January and the time to start planning is now. Please note: Napa County is currently under a stay-at-home order. Non-essential travel is prohibited, but hotels are accepting reservations for future stays. Please visit our Covid news page for more information and updates. Stay There are three new hotels for you to consider when booking your Napa Valley accommodations. Bann at Oak Knoll Napa is a sweet little bed and breakfast that looks nothing like any other hotel in the area. Formerly the Oak Knoll Inn, Bann is decorated to reflect the traditional design of homes found in three different regions in Thailand. Each room and suite is unique with bright colors and an array of fun textures, materials, and patterns. The property has decks and pergolas for lounging, a pool and spa, and offers complimentary breakfast and afternoon tea service. Courtesy of Bann at Oak Knoll Napa Valley's northernmost and arguably-sleepiest town of Calistoga is in the middle of a renaissance, thanks in part to new, luxury hotels. One of Calistoga's oldest resorts, Dr. Wilkinson's, has just wrapped up a head-to-toe renovation and will be open for reservations starting mid-January. The resort dates back to 1952 and was allegedly the town's original wellness resort that tourists sought out for relaxation in the spring-fed mineral pools and mud baths. Post-makeover, Dr. Wilkinson's Backyard Resort & Mineral Springs stays true to its roots \u2014 and the iconic neon sign remains \u2014 but now it's all shiny, contemporary, and new with a totally-chic, reimagined spa and a restaurant, House of Better. Courtesy of Dr. Wilkinson's Backyard Resort & Mineral Springs The Four Seasons Resort and Residences Napa Valley on the edge of downtown Calistoga (Take the Silverado Trail north from Napa until it ends) was set to open in 2020, but like many new businesses, they were delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The resort is now set to open in early 2021 and features a pool, spa, multiple dining options, and even a winery, run by top Napa Valley winemaker Thomas River Brown, who's been awarded 23 100-point scores from wine critic Robert Parker throughout his career. When making your reservation, snag one of the vineyard view rooms \u2014 relaxing, light-filled accommodations complete with vaulted ceilings, in-room fireplaces, and stunning views of vineyards and the Palisades Mountains. Courtesy of Four Seasons Resort and Residences Napa Valley Sip New Spots for Wine There are a handful of new Napa Valley wineries to visit and taste at. Please note: these are all appointment-only. One of the most exciting new winery openings is Faust Haus , a four-year restoration project in an 1800s Victorian that sits on a hilltop overlooking Hwy 29. It's the first-ever home for longtime Napa cabernet brand Faust Wines, which specializes in wines from Napa Valley's up-and-coming Coombsville AVA. The views of the valley and vineyards below are unmatched, while the sophisticated, simple, and at times eclectic interior is a design lover's dream. Make sure you check out the Prohibition-era cellar before you leave. For a low key wine tasting of high-end vino, swing by the Oasis by Hoopes , which has stripped away all pomp and circumstance in favor of a more casual atmosphere featuring a regenerative farm, garden, airstreams, farm stand, and animal sanctuary (they've got a donkey, turkey, chickens, goats, and more). Courtesy of Oasis by Hoopes BRION is unique in that the owner has recruited not one, but three rockstar Napa winemakers, each focused on crafting a single-vineyard cabernet sauvignon from a region of Napa Valley that they're most familiar with. The winery and tasting room, which opened to visitors at the end of 2020, have been built into a carefully restored bank barn (one of just two remaining in California), offering a one-of-a-kind tasting experience that takes place far off the main road with a view of the estate vineyards. In St. Helena, longtime family-owned wine brand Lang & Reed recently opened a new, cozy tasting salon just a block off the town's Main Street. Lang & Reed does things differently, focusing on the production of cabernet franc and chenin blanc, two grape varieties you won't find bottled by themselves too often in Napa Valley. Sit out on the quiet front porch of the tasting room and sip away the afternoon in the bucolic St. Helena, where you can also do some shopping and dining when you're done. Courtesy of BRAND Napa Valley | Tubay Yabut Finally, BRAND Napa Valley isn't technically new, but it does have new ownership, which unveiled a stunning winery and tasting room redesign in 2020. Located high up on Napa's esteemed Pritchard Hill, this is definitely one of those off-the-beaten-path gems for fine wine lovers and collectors. A Perfect Pairing Salt and acid are scientifically proven to be a great culinary match and this concept has inspired a trio of Napa Valley wineries to experiment with a different kind of food and wine pairing experience. Shaking things up from the standard wine and cheese experiences in Wine Country, Shadowbox Cellars , Silver Trident Winery , and Markham Vineyards have all launched unique and super-casual wine and potato chip pairings. Each wine is carefully paired with a different flavored chip, like Dry Aged Ribeye or Hawaiian Red Sea Salt at Shadowbox. Courtesy of Markham Vineyards New Wine Bars There are two new wine bars in Napa and each is specifically catered to a certain type of wine lover. Bar Lucia in the Oxbow Public Market pours all things pink. Patrons can ros\u00e9 all day year-round with more than a dozen of local, small production ros\u00e9s produced several ways: still, sparkling, frozen, and sometimes in a can. There are a handful of whites and reds for those who are feeling more traditional and as for food, Bar Lucia has small plates like dips and charcuterie boards, salads, and sandwiches. Courtesy of Bar Lucia True to its name, Be Bubbly in downtown Napa proves that sparkling wine isn't just for special occasions. The menu features bubbles from all over the globe \u2014 Champagnes, Proseccos, Cavas, and more \u2014 in a wide range of price points with small bites (caviar, charcuterie, cheesy sticks, etc.) to pair. Courtesy of Be Bubbly | Bryan Gray Something Different If you need a palate cleanser during a Napa Valley visit, head to the new California Brandy House , which opened downtown at First Street Napa at the end of 2020. Sip through a flight of California's luxury brandies made from California wine grapes \u2014 including single-barrel samples that you can't get anywhere else \u2014 from producers Argonaut and Germain-Robin. You can even take home a custom-engraved bottle to enjoy throughout the rest of the year (or give as a gift). Courtesy of California Brandy House Eat EmpressM , a new, fine-dining dim sum and Chinese restaurant, offers traditional dishes that celebrate the \u201ceight regional cuisines,\u201d including Peking Duck, Sichuan Spicy Fish, and Mongolian Lamb Chops. Dim sum plates include vegetarian options like spinach, snow pea, and mushroom dumplings, seafood, and more adventurous bites, like chicken feet. EmpressM is just down the way from La Cheve , a Mexican bakery, brewery, and restaurant that opened this past summer inside Napa's oldest building, an adobe that dates back to 1845. The beer is brewed in-house by owner Cinthya Cisneros, and her mother, Mama Juana, makes all of the pastries, including ones with booze in them. Courtesy of La Cheve For a quick, yet fulfilling bite between tastings, grab some authentic, Argentine empanadas from El Porte\u00f1o in flavors like Carne, La Maradona (tomatoes, basil, and mozzarella), and Esparragos (asparagus, roasted red peppers, Gouda). El Porte\u00f1o built up a loyal following at the Ferry Building in San Francisco and is now the newest vendor at the Oxbow Public Market with its second brick and mortar. While Napa Valley is known to be sleepy and limited on nightlife, a new card room and restaurant is opening to kick-off 2021 with a little more action. Operating outside (for now), Ace & Vine will stay open until 2 a.m. and feature Blackjack, Texas Holdem, and Baccarat tables. Food and drinks can be ordered from The Deck, serving up Asian and comfort food fusion dishes like lobster fish and chips, a dim sum-style steamed salmon basket, and the Nam Tok Burger with spicy pork belly and papaya slaw. Fleetwood, Courtesy of Calistoga Motor Lodge In the spring, the Calistoga Motor Lodge & Spa will open its new restaurant called Fleetwood , specializing in original craft cocktails and farm-to-table, wood-fired pizzas \u2014 which hotel guests can even order poolside \u2014 like Potato Leek with taleggio, bacon, chili flake, and parmesan or the Roasted Chicken with garlic cream, asparagus, pepperoncini, lemon, and herbs. For dessert, there's even a 9-inch wood fire cookie. Shop First Street Napa , a high-end, outdoor shopping area full of boutique local retailers, continues to grow and evolve in downtown Napa. There's a slew of new shops \u2014 13 to be exact \u2014 that opened in 2020, making this destination worthy of an afternoon visit (there are plenty of restaurants and tasting rooms there, plus hotels, too). Notable newcomers include Honey Whiskey , I-Elle , and Tay & Grace clothing boutiques, Riza Plants , and Paint Nail Bar . There are some nationally-known brands to shop as well, and First Street Napa just announced that Anthropologie will be opening in mid-2021. Courtesy of First Street Napa With so many new and beautiful wineries, restaurants, shops, and hotels to explore in Napa Valley Wine Country, this is the perfect destination for dipping your toes back in the travel game after a long year away. \u2013 The Perfect Winter Getaway to Calistoga and Napa's Up Valley \u2013 \u2013 Things to do in Downtown Napa: A Traveler's Guide \u2013 Author Jess Lander Jess Lander is a freelance wine, food and travel writer based in Napa Valley and exploring all things California wine country.

        "title": "Choosing The Best Wine Glasses for Napa Wines",
        "text": "If you find yourself constantly reaching for Napa Valley wines with dinner, or just want to elevate your at-home wine drinking experience, you may want to consider investing in glassware designed to enhance your overall enjoyment of Napa wines. While it's not necessary to spend a fortune on the \u201cproper\u201d glassware for each wine varietal \u2014 and if we're being honest, you can drink wine from whatever vessel you'd prefer, even if said vessel is a coffee mug or Solo cup \u2014 there is truth in that the shape of a glass can make a difference in the wine's overall appeal. So, if you're ready to take your wine glass game up a notch, here are tips for choosing the right wine glasses for your favorite Napa wines. Why Does Shape Matter? Certain wine glasses are specifically designed to improve the taste and character of a wine by directing aromatic compounds and taste profiles to hit different areas of the nose and tongue. Essentially what happens is, when you swirl and taste, the shape of a glass will affect the position of those flavor compounds as they reach your nose or mouth, making the wine come more alive, or not, depending on the vessel design. And no, we're not just saying that, it's actually been scientifically proven! Now that you know that vessel shape matters, you may be wondering if stemless or stemmed wine glasses are preferable. While some argue that wine, especially white, should never be served in a stemless glass (your hand can warm up the wine too quickly), the stem versus stemless debate doesn't matter as much as the shape and size of the bowl. So whether you opt for fancy stemmed wine glasses or modern, everyday stemless ones, the most important thing in choosing the best glassware is that your glass bowl has enough space above the wine to swirl and collect aromas in the glass. Courtesy of Liquor.com Best Wine Glasses for Cabernet Sauvignon Chances are, if you like Napa wine, then you are probably a fan of cabernet, widely known as the King of Napa grapes. When it comes to wine glasses, a good fit for cabernet sauvignon and other bold red wines is the traditional \u201cBordeaux Glass,\u201d which consists of a large, less rounded bowl with height, or the \u201cCabernet Glass,\u201d which is broad but slightly smaller than the Bordeaux. Since Napa cabernets tend to be high in alcohol and tannin, that extra distance between you and the wine allows some of the typical \u2018burn' of the ethanol to dissolve before it reaches your nose, while a wider opening lets in more oxygen and directs the wine to the back of the mouth, softening the harshness of the tannins as you sip. Try: Riedel Extreme Cabernet Glass Zalto Denk'Art Bordeaux Crystal Glass Riedel O Wine Tumbler Best Wine Glasses for Chardonnay Though some white wines are served in smaller bowled glasses, which preserve delicate aromas and acidity, full-bodied and oaked whites like chardonnay are better suited to larger glasses. A \u201cWhite Burgundy Glass,\u201d which is similar in shape to a pinot noir glass, features a wide bowl and narrow rim, thereby concentrating the aromatics of the creamier, oaked whites in order to offset some of the richness of the fruit. Unoaked or younger chardonnays, on the other hand, tend to be served in traditional white wine glasses, known as the \u201cChardonnay Glass.\u201d Its slightly narrower rim concentrates aromas more precisely, while allowing some of the more apparent acidity from stainless steel fermentation to shine through. Try: Riedel VINUM Chardonnay Glass Eisch Superior Chardonnay Glass Lenox Tuscany Classics Chardonnay Glass Best Wine Glasses for Sauvignon Blanc Unlike chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and other light-bodied, acidic white wines fare better in smaller bowled glasses. A narrow rim preserves aromas while a less broad bowl allows the wine to maintain a cooler temperature. Its shape also directs the wine to the center of your palate to avoid the unfavorable mouth puckering sensation that can be caused by high levels of acidity reaching the sides of your tongue. Try: Zalto Denk'Art White Wine Glass Schott Zwiesel Tritan Crystal White Wine Glass Spiegelau Grande White Wine Glasses Best Wine Glasses for Zinfandel Zinfandel from Napa Valley tends to be bold with ripe fruit notes and peppery, allspice characters. Medium-sized red wine glasses with a slightly larger rim work well for zinfandel by supporting the bouquet while softening some of the strong flavors and alcohol as it hits your tongue. Try: Riedel Wine Series Zinfandel Glass Waterford Marquis Red Wine Glass Gunmetal Black Stemless Wine Glass Best Wine Glasses for Sparkling Wine While coups are a stylish nod to a bygone era, they really aren't the best vessels for sparkling wine as they allow in too much oxygen, thereby diminishing the wine's effervescence \u2014 and sparkling wine just isn't the same without those bubbles. While a Champagne flute is also synonymous with bubbly, its narrow opening (and standard high pour) make it hard to appreciate the wine's aromas. For optimal drinking pleasure, kiss the flute and coupe goodbye and instead opt for a tulip glass or tapering wine glass, which both allow bubbles to form and aromas to unfold.

Many stemware producers, including Zalto and Gabriel-Glas (our go-tos), are making universal glasses which are high in quality and generally work well with any type of wine. All-purpose glassware is not only space-saving (more room on the shelf!) and good for your budget (you'll save on multiple sets of varietal-specific drinkware), they're also a great option for those wine enthusiasts who simply don't want to fuss over matching glass style with varietal. Try: Zalto Denk'Art Universal Glass Gabriel-Glas StandArt Edition Libbey All Purpose Wine Glass Glass vs. Crystal Crystal glasses offer an elegant, thin design, but they are usually much more expensive than glass. Hand washing is also strongly encouraged, so if you prefer barware that can go in the dishwasher then glass or dishwasher-safe crystal may be for you. Glass wine glasses are usually cost-effective and durable, but they are often not as well designed as their crystal counterparts when it comes to enhancing the flavors in wine. Simply put, choosing glass or crystal wine glasses really comes down to lifestyle. Super serious about your wine tasting? Then invest in better performing glassware. Too worried about breaking your precious Zalto glasses that it takes the fun out of drinking from them? Go cheaper. You can't go wrong finding something that is right for you. \u2013 12 Best Cabernets in Napa Valley \u2013 \u2013 How to Read a Napa Valley Wine Label \u2013 Author Hana-Lee Sedgwick Hana-Lee Sedgwick is a writer and editor based in Santa Barbara, California.

        "title": "A Perfect Winter Getaway to Calistoga and Napa's Up Valley",
        "text": "While winter in other parts of the world can be a bit, well, frightful, winter in Napa Valley is something special. The busy harvest season has calmed down, there are less crowds of people, and everyone is feeling a little more relaxed and joyful as the holidays and New Year draw near. All these reasons, and more, make winter one of the best times to visit the quaint town of Calistoga , a charming community in the northern region of the Napa Valley known for its relaxing hotels and inns, intimate restaurants, world-class wine, and therapeutic hot springs. Oh, and did we mention it's surrounded by some of the most picturesque landscapes in Northern California? Sounds dreamy, doesn't it? In case that's not enough to convince you, if you visit between December 5, 2020 and February 7, 2021, you can take advantage of the Calistoga Winter in the Wineries Passport and receive complimentary tastings at 15 of the finest wineries throughout Calistoga and the surrounding regions, like Lake County and St. Helena, plus complimentary corkage at participating restaurants and discounts at Calistoga lodging, spas, and shops. The Passport is only $60 per person and is valued at over $400 in wine tastings alone. What are you waiting for? Pack your bags and kiss those winter blues goodbye, because a winter weekend in Wine Country awaits. Courtesy of Visit Calistoga Day One Mid-Day Welcome to Napa Valley's \u201cUp Valley\u201d! Before you check in to your hotel in Calistoga, plan to venture 30 miles north to start your weekend by wine tasting in Lake County. This laid-back region, home to over 30 wineries, is certainly one of Northern California's best kept secrets, and as a Passholder, you'll get to enjoy complimentary tastings at three of its top wineries. Stop at Six Sigma Winery to sip tempranillo and cabernet sauvignon in the middle of a 4,300-acre working ranch. Besides wine, you can purchase ranch-raised meat, local cheeses, and crackers \u2014 all the fixings to make your own picnic to enjoy with your wine. Nearby, the boutique Fults Family Vineyards showcases a variety of limited-production red wines from their tasting room, which looks out over the 45-acre property. Savor your time in Lake County by also reserving a tasting at Boatique Winery , a beautiful estate vineyard and winery that features olive trees, picturesque grounds, and an antique wooden boat collection. Courtesy of Boatique Winery Late Afternoon Now, it's time for the scenic drive back to Calistoga to check in to your accommodation. There are plenty of options when it comes to places to call home in and around Calistoga (with discounts available on lodging and spa treatments for Passport holders), so you really can't go wrong. Plan to stay at The Bergson , a charming boutique hotel in the heart of Calistoga. Each of the 21 rooms and suites features elegant decor and luxurious amenities designed to unwind, such as fireplaces, jetted tubs, feather beds, and plush bathrobes. Nearby, the Calistoga Spa Hot Springs is another good lodging option in town, where contemporary rooms are set amidst a peaceful setting. Book a spa treatment, like a mud bath or a massage, then follow it with a dip in one of the four geothermal outdoor mineral pools. Courtesy of Calistoga Spa Hot Springs Also noteworthy: the playfully designed Calistoga Motor Lodge and Spa , featuring retro-inspired rooms and suites (some of which are pet-friendly), a spa, a geothermal mineral pool, and a convivial vibe; the Aurora Park Cottages , where a stay in one of the private cottages includes complimentary breakfast and bike rentals; and the Bungalows at Calistoga , home to three chic, inviting Wine Country bungalows that sleep up to four people. Evening End your first day with dinner at Evangeline , a popular French bistro \u201cwith a Creole soul\u201d in downtown Calistoga. The covered garden patio is a lovely place to savor comforting bistro classics like steak frites, as well as creole-inspired dishes like gumbo and shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e. Or, consider eating at Veraison , a bistro and wine bar offering a seasonally-driven menu and wines from around the world. As with all of the participating restaurants, a Passport gets you complimentary corkage on a bottle of wine from any of the participating wineries. Day Two Morning If your hotel doesn't offer complimentary breakfast, be sure to pay a visit to Cafe Sarafornia for a comforting and satisfying meal that will set you up for a full day of wine tasting and exploring. Courtesy of Chateau Montelena After breakfast, head to your tasting appointment at Chateau Montelena, located two miles from downtown. This historic estate features an ivy covered stone castle built into the hillside, as well as a picturesque Chinese garden, complete with bridges, a lake, and even swans. Enjoy a complimentary tasting with your Passport, then be sure to leave time to explore the grounds before venturing down the road to your next stop: Tamber Bey . This equestrian training facility and sanctuary, home to more than 20 horses, is also a working winery and tasting room, where you can sample single-vineyard, single-varietal wines and Bordeaux blends while admiring the horses. Or, if you feel like getting out of Calistoga, head eight miles south to visit Beringer , located in St. Helena. One of the most historic properties in Napa Valley, Beringer has earned a reputation for its cabernet sauvignons made from sustainably-farmed vineyards throughout Napa. Afterwards, head over the hill to Pope Valley Winery for a tour, tasting, and Bocce ball at this historic, family-owned winery, or stop into any number of wineries in and around Calistoga on your way back, such as Clos Pegase , Girard , Hans Fahden , Madrigal Family Winery , and Von Strasser (all part of the Passport series). Courtesy of Pope Valley Winery Afternoon After all that wine, head back into town to fuel up with a panini sandwich or light bite from Sam's General Store , then venture out for an afternoon of shopping. Stop by Blackbird for artisanal finds for the home and tabletop, as well as toys and games for kids. If a unique, handmade gift is what you're after, you can also call ahead to visit Calistoga Pottery , where you'll find a wide variety of pottery items made by Jeff and Sally Manfredi, who have been making pottery together for 40 years. For a great selection of men's and women's clothing, jewelry, shoes, and housewares, check out Sugardaddy's Consignment , a popular local thrift store. All of these stores, and more, are offering 10% off of regularly priced items to Passport holders. Courtesy of Calistoga Chamber If more wine is what you're after (hey, it is Wine Country, after all), then stroll over to Tank Garage Winery , a winery and tasting room inside a converted 1930s gas station with a youthful, welcoming vibe and a focus on small-lot, natural wines. You can also check out T-Vine Winery , a friendly tasting room featuring wines from some of the last remaining old-vine, heritage vineyards in California. Evening For a casual dinner (and a break from the wine), stop into Lincoln Avenue Brewery for brews on tap, satisfying pub fare, and a lively atmosphere. There's also the popular Calistoga Inn Restaurant & Brewery , where you'll find an expansive patio and a diverse menu featuring everything from elevated pub fare, such as garlic crusted calamari and prosciutto and fig pizza, to hearty, seasonal mains, including wood grilled rack of lamb and butternut squash cannelloni. Courtesy of Calistoga Inn Day Three Morning It's almost time to head home, but before you leave, grab a pastry and coffee from Sam's General Store then walk over to Picayune Cellars for one last wine tasting before hitting the road. Or, plan for a rejuvenating late morning spa treatment at Mount View Spa , MoonAcre Spa , or the Spa at Solage as you prepare to bid Calistoga, and the lovely Napa Valley, adieu. Courtesy of Calistoga Chamber The 11th annual Winter in the Wineries Passport is held in partnership with the Calistoga Chamber, Visit Calistoga, and the San Francisco Chronicle. Passports can be purchased online and are valid from December 5, 2020 through February 7, 2021. \u2013 Guide to a Weekend in Calistoga \u2013 \u2013 The 7 Best Hotels in Calistoga \u2013 Author Hana-Lee Sedgwick Hana-Lee Sedgwick is a writer and editor based in Santa Barbara, California.

        "title": "Experience Mumm Napa This Season",
        "text": "Napa Valley may be most known for its cabernet sauvignon, but don't discount the beauty of sparkling wine from Napa \u2014 particularly when your palate needs a break from the big, bold red wines. Hello, palate cleanser! Though you can't refer to California sparkling wine as \u201cChampagne\u201d \u2014 that's reserved for bubbly coming out of the Champagne region of France \u2014 this beloved celebratory drink has long been revered in Napa Valley, making a name for itself as a premier region for sparkling wine. Among those producers who have paved the way for sparkling production in Napa Valley is Mumm Napa , which was founded in the late 1970s after the leading French Champagne brand, G.H. Mumm, recognized the enormous potential for producing exceptional sparkling wine in Napa. Mumm Napa released its first vintage in 1983, and has since carried on the tradition of producing hand-crafted sparkling wine from the prominent grapes of Champagne: chardonnay, pinot noir, pinot meunier, and pinot gris. Made in a wide variety of styles, from brut to demi sec, and varietals, from the classic Brut Prestige to the award-winning DVX, each of Mumm's sparkling wines is produced using the traditional winemaking techniques of its French heritage, formally known as the M\u00e9thode Traditionnelle. While one can enjoy Mumm's array of California bubblies at home and for any occasion \u2014 sparkling wine has a way of elevating everything from milestone events to Tuesday night take-out \u2014 the best way to fully appreciate Mumm's dedication to their craft is by visiting their Rutherford winery in person. Fall is a great time of year to visit, as the vineyards display gorgeous shades of red and gold, but it's also an opportune time for sparkling wine lovers to stock up before the holidays \u2014 especially since the winery just released their much-anticipated Sparkling Pinot Noir . This fun, elegant, relatively rare 100% pinot noir sparkling wine is a must for Thanksgiving fare and holiday spreads. Shares winemaker Tami Lotz, \u201cI'm still finalizing the dishes I'll prepare for the holidays, but there is one thing that will always be on the table: a bottle of Sparkling Pinot Noir. I love the way this lighter expression of pinot noir unites all the varied flavors of the Thanksgiving table.\u201d Mumm Napa Tasting Experiences To experience Mumm Napa, and to be among the first to taste their new Sparkling Pinot Noir, you can book a reservation for any of these three tasting experiences: Outdoor Patio Tasting Featuring sweeping views of the surrounding vineyards, this casual 60-minute experience on the outdoor terrace includes a hand-picked flight of reserve sparkling wines. If a tasting isn't your thing, you can choose from the extended by the glass menu, then sit back and enjoy every delicious sip. Price: $40 per person / complimentary for Club Vivant Members. Limited to groups of six or less. Vineyard Green Tasting Available Fridays through Sundays, this one-hour al fresco tasting includes a selection of reserve wines by the flight or by the glass, enjoyed from the relaxed setting of the Vineyard Green patio. As with the Outdoor Patio tasting, this experience is made even better by the unobstructed views of the surrounding vineyards. Price: $40 per person / complimentary for Club Vivant Members. Limited to groups of four or less. Oak Terrace Tasting For a more extensive introduction to Mumm's sparkling wine offerings, book the Oak Terrace Tasting. This 75-minute experience, held on the leisurely Oak Terrace overlooking the vines, includes a flight of four limited-production sparkling wines, such as the Brut Ros\u00e9 and their t\u00eate de cuv\u00e9e, the DVX, and is served alongside a special selection of artisan cheeses, dried fruit, and nuts to complement each wine. Price: $75 per person / $60 for Club Vivant Members. Limited to groups of six or less. Reservations are required in advance for all tasting experiences and guests must be 21 or older.

        "text": "While Napa Valley's devastating Glass Fire is nearly contained, thanks to the heroic efforts of our first responders risking their lives to save the Napa community, unfortunately many businesses were not able to make it through unscathed. The damage to some of Napa Valley's most beloved and acclaimed wineries, resorts, and restaurants varies greatly, but there is no doubt all of these businesses will feel the effects of the Napa fire for years to come. Though our Wine Country regions have faced fires and other natural disasters in the past and have consistently exhibited resiliency and strength, it doesn't sting any less for the many people whose livelihoods have been lost or badly affected. In an effort to help you better understand what's been damaged, as well as share ways you can support some of these businesses as they assess their losses and work to rebuild, here is a full list of all the Napa Valley wineries and hotels that have been damaged in the Glass Fire.

        "text": "Although Napa Valley only accounts for four percent of total wine production in the United States, its reputation for producing fine wine is known the world over. The all-encompassing term \u201cNapa Valley\u201d is often used when talking about the wines, but a deep dive into the nuances of various AVAs within Napa \u2014 from St. Helena, Calistoga, Rutherford, and beyond \u2014 reveal how complex the region and its terroir actually is. While cabernet sauvignon may be the marquee grape, Napa's warm and sunny Mediterranean climate makes it an ideal place to grow a wide range of varieties. Here are some of the top grapes of Napa Valley and wines to look for in a tasting room or to enjoy at home. Cabernet Sauvignon The reigning grape in the region, cabernet sauvignon often shows dark red and black fruits, tobacco, mocha, and hints of spice. With its medium to full body and great structure, it's no wonder the grape has become a signature for Napa Valley. Wine to try: Louis M. Martini , Lot 1 Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley Merlot As either a partner to cabernet in a Bordeaux-style blend or as a varietal wine, merlot's fruit-forward profile and plush texture show an added finesse in Napa's terroir. Plummy and juicy but still savory, merlot is a popular choice during a wine tasting experience. Wine to try: Robert Mondavi , Merlot, Napa Valley Cabernet Franc Cabernet franc plays a vital role for a winery focused on blends, but an increase in vineyards of this lighter-bodied and spicy red grape shows a growing passion for varietal bottlings \u2014 even single-vineyard focused wines. Wine to try: La Jota Vineyards , Cabernet Franc, Howell Mountain, Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc A highly aromatic varietal, sauvignon blanc from Napa is distinctly different from sauvignon blancs from France or New Zealand. Here, it shows bright tropical fruits and an irresistible zestiness which make it a very food-friendly wine. While often fermented in stainless steel, it can also be aged in neutral oak barrels to add texture, as is the case with Grgich Hills' Fum\u00e9 Blanc. Wine to try: Grgich Hills Estate , Fum\u00e9 Blanc, Napa Valley Zinfandel Although cabernet sauvignon may be the most planted grape variety in Napa, zinfandel may be the most historic. Often called America's heritage grape, some of the best wines come from old vines that were planted pre-Prohibition. Usually a full-bodied, fruit-forward wine, zinfandel holds special meaning for many winemakers due to its legacy. Wine to try: Robert Biale Vineyards , Black Chicken Zinfandel, Napa Valley Sparkling Wine Given all the bold reds that Napa is famous for, it may surprise some to learn that high-end, traditional method sparkling wines are also a mainstay of the region. Book a tasting experience at estates like Domaine Carneros and you wouldn't be faulted for thinking you're in Champagne. Wine to try: Domaine Carneros by Taittinger, Estate Brut Cuv\u00e9e, Napa Valley Petite Sirah/Syrah Although not a widely known grape, petite syrah is often used as a blending grape. However, some intrepid winemakers produce stunning single-vineyard wines, often from old vines. As a young varietal it can be inky in color and dense in texture, but over time it mellows and exudes a beautiful bouquet. Wine to try: Turley Wine Cellars , Hayne Vineyard Petite Syrah, Napa Valley Pinot Noir Although pinot noir is most closely associated with the neighboring region of Sonoma, the thin-skinned grape thrives in cooler pockets of Napa. Its fruit character is more prominent when grown in Napa soils, but it still retains those lithe and savory qualities that are distinct to the varietal. Wine to try: Charles Krug , Carneros Pinot Noir, Napa Valley Pinot Bianco While it's long been accepted that French grapes thrive in Napa Valley, some estates look to other countries for inspiration. Italian grapes, in particular, are capturing the attention of winemakers. Dan Petroski, head winemaker at Larkmead Vineyards, cultivates white varieties like Pinot Bianco and Greco in Napa and Sonoma. Pinot Bianco, with its fresh fruit notes and bright acidity, is a showstopper. Wine to try: Massican , Gemina, Napa Valley Petit Verdot Almost always a supporting character in Napa blends, Petit Verdot still makes its presence known. A thick-skinned grape that does best in warm climates, it provides tannin and structure to many wines. Wine to try: Duckhorn , The Discussion, Napa Valley \u2013 An Introduction to Napa Valley AVAs \u2013 \u2013 How to Read a Napa Valley AVA Wine Label \u2013 Author Shana Clarke Shana Clarke is a freelance journalist and consultant based in New York City.

        "text": "It's hard to believe we are reaching out again with an update on wildfires in Napa Valley and Sonoma County. These circumstances have always been personal for our WineCountry Media team, as we work and live in these communities and know the people behind the businesses and organizations affected \u2014 for some the loss has been truly unimaginable. 2020 has been made up of an extraordinary collection of challenges for all of us.

Plan a visit to Napa Valley and Sonoma County.

        "title": "Louis M. Martini Winery's Outdoor Food & Wine Experiences",
        "text": "Situated north of the city of Napa and just south of the town of St. Helena sits Louis M. Martini Winery , looming and impressive yet simultaneously sleek and modern. Since unveiling its restored winery and hospitality center last year, Louis M. Martini has become a go-to destination for wine aficionados and architecture buffs alike, drawing visitors to enjoy a variety of memorable tasting experiences set amidst the chic, contemporary design. After closing its stately doors due to Covid-19, Louis M. Martini Winery is once again welcoming visitors, though all tasting experiences are currently taking place outdoors by reservation only . Luckily, the winery's picturesque Martini Park \u2014 a relaxing outdoor oasis ideal for safely enjoying al fresco tasting experiences \u2014 has reopened for its second season, and just in time for summer. Not only does Martini Park provide an idyllic outdoor garden from which to experience Louis M. Martini Winery's iconic Napa Valley wines, but the expansive space is naturally conducive to social distancing. History Louis M. Martini Winery's journey as one of the oldest and the longest continuously operated wineries in the Napa Valley to modern icon has spanned almost a century. Renowned for their small-lot and single-vineyard cabernet sauvignons and esteemed vineyard holdings such as the famed Monte Rosso Vineyard, this long-standing Napa Valley winery has been extremely influential throughout the region's history. Beginning with the original founder Louis M. Martini and continuing with the two generations that followed after him, this historic winery and its founders have played an influential role in establishing Napa Valley as one of the world's premier wine regions \u2014 especially as one recognized for its world-class cabernet sauvignon. Courtesy of Louis M. Martini | Kristen Cropper Restoration Louis M. Martini Winery and Estate underwent a significant restoration, completed in early 2019. Last spring, the winery reopened with a contemporary winery and hospitality center featuring a series of new tasting, event, and education spaces, a restored underground cellar event room with private entry (for those who may need to arrive and depart privately), and an outdoor space including a state-of-the-art kitchen, cabanas, and outdoor courtyard seating. The new winery building, designed to showcase reclaimed materials while incorporating a modern and open style, features an impressive tasting room that offers views of the cellar beyond glass walls, a large tasting lounge designed to host guests for small-lot or reserve wine tastings, a special room for culinary demonstrations, a state-of-the-art Wine Study, and an executive meeting space. Adjacent to the newly constructed winery building sits Martini Park, the winery's large outdoor area where guests can enjoy al fresco wine and food experiences, which originally opened in March of 2019. Crown Bar at Louis M. Martini New Culinary Program Among the most significant additions to the winery during the redesign was the creation of a new culinary program, headed by Chef Jeffery Russell, a CIA alumnus with over a decade of fine-dining experience at restaurants such as Aureole in New York and Charlie Palmer Steak in Washington, D.C., and Napa. Chef Russell's approach to food is inspired and innovative. For Russell, running the winery's culinary program is a \u2018dream job'. Not only is he able to source the best ingredients and work with an amazing space and team, but the ever-changing seasonal nature of the pairing menus he and his team create, assure that they are constantly moving, learning, and being challenged. Since last year's launch of their new culinary program, Louis M. Martini has offered a selection of world-class wine and food tasting experiences. Among these new offerings are their outdoor Martini Park and Cabana Experiences (held in Martini Park). The Martini Park Experience The Martini Park wine tasting experience includes a tasting flight of three signature wines with optional food pairings, served al fresco at bistro-style tables in the Martini Park courtyard, which sits adjacent to Martini's Heritage Lounge. Guests are seated at outdoor tables and served one white wine to taste, followed by two signature red wines and a plate consisting of three housemade food pairings designed to complement the selected wines. Guests are encouraged to relax and take their time while enjoying their wine and food, but should they desire to stay longer and enjoy more wine, bottle service is available. The Martini Park experience is offered daily by reservation. The cost of a wine and food pairing is $45, while a wine tasting without the food pairing is $30. Martini Park, Courtesy of Louis M. Martini | Steve Orozco The Cabana Experience The Cabana Experience is an optimal choice for groups who would like additional privacy as well as a more extensive wine and food experience. Guests are led to a semi-private and covered \u2018cabana' seating area in Martini Park, where they are encouraged to relax on comfortable sofas, shaded from the sun, while enjoying a tasting of Louis M. Martini's Napa Valley wines alongside wood-fired pizzas, spit-roasted meats, and drool-worthy, seasonally-inspired bites (including desserts) prepared by Chef Jeffrey and his team in the Park's expansive outdoor kitchen. The Martini Cabana Experience is scheduled to resume in July. Cabanas will be available to guests for four hours at a time so that they can fully relax and enjoy a leisurely wine and food experience, conversation, and downtime before returning to the outside world. The cost per person (including all wine and food) is $150. Martini Park Cabana The Heritage Lounge Experience In addition to the Martini Park tasting currently offered, the Heritage Lounge Tasting is also available to guests. Hosted outdoors on the serene Heritage Terrace looking out at Martini Park, this seated experience features five of the winery's most sought-after small-lot wines, elevated by Chef Russell's exquisite culinary pairings. The Heritage Lounge Tasting is available daily by appointment. The cost of a wine and food pairing is $90, though visitors can choose to experience the wine tasting without the food pairing for $60.

        "title": "First-Time Visitor's Guide to Lake County Wine Country",
        "text": "Home to over 30 wineries and 9,000 acres of vineyards, Lake County has become one of Northern California's best kept secrets. This wine growing region north of Napa Valley may share similar soils and climatic conditions to its high-profile neighbor, but it's got a vibe and appeal all its own. Now that businesses have started reopening, it's time to start planning your getaway to Lake County. Get to know this relaxed wine region and all its unspoiled beauty with our first-time visitor's guide, complete with all the best places to eat, stay, play, and sip for when you do decide to visit. History Six Sigma Ranch & Winery, Courtesy of Six Sigma Ranch The first vines in Lake County were planted in the 1870s. Though Lake County was a thriving wine region by the early 1900s, Prohibition quickly put an end to wine production in the area and vineyards were replaced with walnut and pear trees. It wasn't until the 1960s that grape growers returned to the area and started planting vines. Today, Lake County is one of the fastest growing wine regions in all of California, with the number of acres under vine expected to double over the next several years. Terroir & Grapes Clear Lake, Courtesy of LakeCounty.com Lake County contains eight distinct AVAs, all of which are situated around Clear Lake \u2013 California's largest freshwater lake and the oldest lake in North America \u2013 and near the base of Mount Konocti volcano. Here, grapes grow in volcanic, mineral-rich soils at high altitudes of 1,370 to 2,600 feet, where mild summers and cool winter temperatures create ideal conditions for producing elegant, complex wines. While the region has become well-known for its cabernet sauvignon and sauvignon blanc wines, Lake County is also planted to cabernet franc, petit sirah, merlot, syrah, malbec, grenache, zinfandel, viognier, and riesling, among others. Where to Stay The Lodge at Blue Lakes, Courtesy of Booking.com Lake County is a place where visitors come to relax, drink wine, and enjoy the natural surroundings. While lodging options vary throughout Lake County's numerous communities, the majority of accommodations encourage finding a slower pace away from the hustle and bustle. The Lodge at Blue Lakes has been welcoming guests since the 1870s and is a popular place for visitors. Stay in any of the 22 simple, yet tasteful rooms and enjoy complimentary continental breakfast, free Wi-Fi, and access to plenty of water activities. In fact, The Lodge at Blue Lakes has the largest fleet of environmental-friendly electric boats for rent in Northern California. If looking for some peace and quiet among the vines, check out Bed and Barrel at Stonehouse Cellars . This family-owned bed-and-breakfast has three sleek, modern rooms above the Stonehouse Cellars winery, as well as a century old one-bedroom cottage overlooking a pond that provides a bit more seclusion. During a stay, guests receive a farm-fresh breakfast each morning, as well as tastings in the winery. For a more rustic experience in the great outdoors, opt to camp at Clear Lake Campground . Situated along an outlet creek off Clear Lake, the campsite welcomes tents, small trailers, and campers and is a great spot for fishing and bird watching. Where to Sip Brassfield Estate Winery, Courtesy of Nick Elias Located on the southern end of Lake County, Six Sigma Ranch \u2018s tasting room sits in a cozy cabin on what was once a stagecoach stop. Surrounded by majestic oak trees in the middle of a 4,300-acre working ranch, Six Sigma is a peaceful place to enjoy a picnic while sipping on their acclaimed tempranillo, cabernet, and sauvignon blanc. Nearby, Fults Family Vineyards welcomes with a tasting room overlooking the property's 45 acres of vineyards. This two-generation family-owned boutique winery, which produces less than 1,500 cases annually, is focused on cabernet sauvignon, petit sirah, old vine zinfandel, and red blends. Situated on a hill offering picturesque views of Clear Lake and the surrounding vines, Gregory Graham is a small-production winery located in the Red Hills appellation of Lake County. Visit this dog-friendly winery and you'll likely find owner and winemaker Greg and his wife pouring the wines, such as their award-winning cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc, zinfandel, and syrah. Also offering stunning views is the grandiose Brassfield Estate , a Mediterranean-inspired winery dedicated to crafting 100% estate wines. Tours are offered by appointment, and there's a serene outdoor picnic area from which to enjoy wine and a cheese plate afterwards. Where to Eat Tallman Hotel, Courtesy of the Tallman Hotel The casual Mike's Breakfast & Lunch in Lucerne keeps locals and visitors coming back thanks to its long list of hearty omelettes, benedicts, and burgers, while the Lucerne Euro Market & Bistro charms with lighter breakfast fare, fresh salads, and a friendly, down-to-earth vibe. Located in the Tallman Hotel in Upper Lake, Blue Wing Saloon is a nod to the town's original saloon from the 1800s. Expect gourmet pub fare for lunch and dinner, along with a full bar featuring local wines and craft brews. Don't miss their popular Sunday Suppers, which include a multi-course dinner accompanied by live jazz for just $25. The Yard in Lakeport is a relatively new pub that has won fans for its rustic atmosphere and modern, locally-driven menu, featuring everything from pulled pork tacos to fried chicken and waffles. And at O'Meara Bros. Brewing Company , also in Lakeport, mouthwatering comfort food can be washed down with one of the brewery's artisan beers (made on-site!), as well as live music every Saturday. What to Do Courtesy of LakeCounty.com Besides wine tasting, the main draw of a visit to Clear Lake is its easy accessibility to the outdoors. There are hundreds of miles of scenic roads, wilderness areas, and peaceful lakes and reservoirs to discover, as well as more than 300 species of birds that inhabit the area. Spend the day fishing on Clear Lake \u2014 known for its incredible Bass fishing \u2014 or opt for some bird watching at Clear Lake State Park . Swim, kayak, paddleboard, or rent an electric boat in Blue Lakes, hit the road on two wheels to cycle along the scenic countryside via Konocti Regional Trails , or break a sweat via Mt Konocti County Park \u2018s many hiking trails. Looking for something less active? Head to Taylor Observatory for some epic stargazing or simply pull up a chair overlooking the lake while watching the sun go down. Needless to say, there are endless ways to take advantage of Lake County's gorgeous natural landscapes, whether you plan to visit for a weekend or make it a longer getaway. \u2013 Napa Valley Businesses: Who is Open and Closed \u2013 \u2013 Your Guide to Napa's Up Valley \u2013 Author Hana-Lee Sedgwick Hana-Lee Sedgwick is a writer and editor based in Santa Barbara, California.

Courtesy of Mumm Napa Wine, Olive Oil + A Virtual Cooking Class You may not be able to cook up a feast for your mother this year, but you can still cook \u201ctogether\u201d during a virtual cooking experience live from Wine Country. On Friday, May 8 at 4 pm PST, Round Pond Winery in Napa Valley will host a Virtual Mother's Day Brunch Cooking Class . During this free class, you'll learn to make a delectable rolled omelet with goat cheese, microgreens, and Round Pond's Spanish olive oil (a great match with their Rutherford Sauvignon Blanc), as well as smoked salmon and avocado toast with pickled onion, arugula, Meyer lemon oil, and Trout Roe on grilled levain bread (paired with Round Pond's Proprietary White Blend). Completing the brunch is a steak and eggs hash with garden herb chimichurri (an ideal pairing with the Rutherford Cabernet). Treat mom to the wines in advance so she can sip while she cooks, and be sure to add some of Round Pond's estate olive oil , then promise you'll recreate this feast for her another time. It's a thoughtful Mother's Day gift that keeps on giving! Courtesy of Round Pond Winery DISH Membership with The CIA Speaking of cooking, if your mother is a bonafide foodie looking to hone her chef skills, then you may want to consider signing her up for a DISH Membership at the Culinary Institute of America .

However refined, we realize that drinking bold cabernet wine doesn't exactly scream \u201cspringtime.\u201d If your mom normally reaches for lighter wines this time of year, then she may love Fairwinds Estate's vibrant ros\u00e9, particularly their Ros\u00e9 Gift Set . Included are three bottles of 2018 Fairwinds Ros\u00e9 of Cabernet, plus a complimentary wood handle wine opener and $1 shipping \u2014 all for $78.

        "title": "Things to do in Downtown Napa: A Traveler's Guide",
        "text": "Napa Valley boasts plenty of beautiful spots to call home during a visit, but if you're looking for a wide variety of things to do and see all in one convenient location, downtown Napa is the place to be. This once sleepy downtown has undergone a major renaissance in recent years and is now home to an impressive collection of luxury lodging, hip wine bars, celebrity-led restaurants, wine tasting rooms, and beautiful river walks. So park the car, forget about traffic, and take advantage of the urban oasis that is downtown Napa. Here's your guide to making the most of a visit. Eat Well Oxbow Public Market, Courtesy of Oxbow Public Market From award-winning fine dining to farm-to-table casual eateries, downtown Napa is a foodie haven. Simply put, you'll want to make room in your bellies to chow down on all the delicious offerings that Napa has to offer. First on the agenda should be a visit to the lively Oxbow Public Market . A gathering place for gourmet grub in Napa, Oxbow is where you can find everything from oysters and tacos to chocolates and cupcakes. In fact, there are over 20 merchants under one roof, providing endless ways to eat and drink yourself silly! For more delectable fare, follow your nose to Bounty Hunter Wine Bar & Smokin' BBQ . In addition to pulled pork and beer can chicken featuring house-made rubs, Bounty Hunter has 40 wines available by the glass. Another good option is Morimoto , the sleek Napa River restaurant from celebrity chef Masaharu Morimoto, where an extensive selection of sushi, seafood, Wagyu beef, sake, and Japanese Whiskey can be found. Nearby is the noteworthy restaurant, Ang\u00e8le , renowned for its upscale French country cuisine and quaint, romantic atmosphere since 2002. While wine is a natural pairing with French fare, when your palate needs a break from the grape juice, you can't go wrong with one of Ang\u00e8le's fantastic cocktails. Sip & Savor JaM Cellars, Courtesy of JaM Cellars Housed in a former saloon and brothel from the late 1800s, the Vintner's Collective is a good place to sample a wide variety of Napa Valley wines from one location. Here, you'll find over two dozen quality boutique producers who are too small to have their own tasting rooms, with various tasting spaces from which to enjoy their coveted wines. Down the street is New Frontier Wine Co. , a must-stop for serious oenophiles looking to taste fine wines from some of the world's most renowned winemakers \u2013 wines normally only available by allocation. Make a point to stop into Acumen Wine Gallery , featuring a small but high quality collection of organically grown estate wines from Atlas Peak, and WALT Wines , located near the Oxbow Public Market, where tasters can sip their way through 1,000 miles of pinot noir from within the bright, cheerful space. At the eclectic JaM Cellars , wine tastings take place in the casual setting of their music and wine lounge. In addition to JaM's classic vinyl collection and Rolling Stone Magazine clad walls, the tasting room also plays host to weekly live music sets known as JaMSessions. Finally, Mayacamas ' historic winery may be tucked high up in the mountains, but visitors can sample these classic, age-worthy wines in the comforts of Mayacamas' sleek urban space right in the heart of downtown. Compline is a wine bar, restaurant, and bottle shop in one, and a worthy stop while venturing around Napa. Founded by two sommeliers, Compline's wine collection is complete with bottlings from around the world, including some obscure varietals from lesser known regions. Stop in for a glass and light bite, and be sure to check their calendar for educational tastings and events. Around the corner, Cadet Beer & Wine Bar is a popular spot for wine, beer, and tasty provisions. Come for their worldly selection of wine, from rare Champagne to Sonoma Coast pinot noir, bottled beers, and old school vinyl collection. Plus, there's always a fun lineup of regular events and guest wineries worth checking out. If a refreshing pint is calling your name, head to Stone Brewing \u2018s Napa outpost, located inside a historic building from 1877. Locally-brewed craft beers on tap, an eclectic food menu, and indoor and outdoor seating overlooking the river make it a no brainer for beer fans. Other Things to Do Cooking class at CIA at Copia, Courtesy of Facebook: CIA at Copia Foodies and wannabe chefs won't want to miss heading to the CIA at Copia , the ultimate destination for wine, art, and food-related happenings and exhibits. Take a cooking class in the state-of-the-art teaching kitchen, explore the collection of specialty cookware at the Chuck Williams Culinary Arts Museum, or dine on ethnic fare during one of the Monday night pop-up dinners. The CIA at Copia is a wonderful place to immerse yourself in Napa's culinary community. For shopping, head to First Street Napa , the heart of shopping in downtown Napa, where you'll find a variety of boutiques offering the best in fashion, home d\u00e9cor, art, and gifts. Just a short walk away is the historic Uptown Theatre . This renovated art-deco theatre from 1937 regularly welcomes musical and comedy performers, and is a fantastic place to catch a show \u2014 the intimate setting means there's never a bad seat in the house. Looking for something to do that won't cost you much, if at all? Rent bikes for a scenic ride along the paved Napa Valley Vine Trail , which runs 12.5 miles from Napa to Yountville. Or, rent kayaks or paddle boards from Napa Valley Paddle for a fun experience out on the water. They offer guided and unguided rentals by the hour, day, or weekend. Another great activity that won't break the bank is simply walking around downtown to experience the Napa Art Walk , an urban exhibition of public artworks. The sculptures change every couple of years, highlighting the work of various artists from throughout the West Coast. And in the summer months, head to the Veterans Memorial Park Amphitheater for live music during the community's free summer concert series on Friday nights. Explorers at heart won't want to miss the Napa Scavenger Hunt Walking Tour .\u00a0 It's a self-guided walking tour and game you play by following clues provided on your smartphone.\u00a0 Follow the clues, find interesting sights and solve fun puzzles and challenges along the tour.\u00a0 Use coupon code NAPA10 to save 10%! Sleep Soundly Room at Andaz, Courtesy of Andaz The 141-room Andaz is ideally situated right in the heart of downtown Napa, offering the comforts of a boutique hotel with the convenience of being walking distance to shops, restaurants, and tasting rooms. Loft-style rooms feature hardwood floors and deep soaking tubs, while spacious suites offer an added dose of luxury in the way of rain showers, fireplaces, and terraces overlooking downtown. If a view of the river is what you're after, head to the Napa River Inn , perched above the Napa River in the historic Napa Mill. Stay in one of the colorful rooms \u2014 featuring pillow top mattresses, free Wi-Fi, and fresh pastries delivered daily \u2014 and take advantage of the inn's full service spa and evening wine receptions, but be sure to venture out to enjoy some of Napa's best restaurants right outside your door. Located in a quieter part of downtown is the alluring Hennessey House , a 10-room bed and breakfast with a tranquil garden setting and Victorian charm. Along with friendly service, the inn's welcoming amenities, including gourmet breakfasts, a 24-hour sauna, and evening wine and cheese, make a stay here feel extra special.

        "title": "An Introduction to Napa Valley AVAs",
        "text": "The Napa Valley is, indisputably, one of the world's most recognized wine regions. The region received its American Viticultural Area (AVA) designation in 1981, making it California's first AVA, and the country's second overall. In the decades since, the growers and winemakers in the region have worked to gain a greater understanding of the climate and soil types within the AVA and, in doing so, have learned that the region is actually home to many different, distinct meso- and microclimates, each suited to specific grape varieties and winemaking styles. This has resulted in the designation of 16 separate sub-appellations within the Napa Valley that recognize and celebrate the viticultural diversity of the region. Here is a rundown of all 16. Atlas Peak AVA Established in the early 1990s, this cool, high elevation AVA on the western slopes of the Vaca Mountain Range is the most prominent peak in Napa. Its high elevation keeps it about 10-15 degrees cooler than the valley floor, which results in bright, expressive wines with higher acidity than other Napa Valley appellations. Atlas Peak growers supply premium fruit to dozens of wineries in Napa and Sonoma, and local winemakers produce some of the world's finest wines made from cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, petit verdot, and merlot, as well as other classic varieties like sangiovese, syrah, and chardonnay. Wineries to try: Dos Lagos Vineyards , Antica Napa Valley , VinRoc Calistoga AVA, Courtesy of Facebook: Calistoga Wine Growers Calistoga AVA This AVA not only has one of the warmest climates of the region, it is also the most geologically uniform in all of Napa Valley. While summer temperatures can top 100 degrees, they can also drop into the 40s at night due to cool breezes from the Pacific drawn in through the Chalk Hill mountain gap. This diurnal shift is a grape grower's dream, as it results in fully ripe grapes balanced by fresh acidity. Principal varieties here include cabernet sauvignon, zinfandel, syrah, and petite sirah. Wineries to try: Fairwinds Estate Winery , Chateau Montelena , Sterling Vineyards , Kenefick Ranch Vineyards Chiles Valley District AVA Established in 1999 and located in the Eastern hills of Napa Valley, Chiles Valley is among the smallest AVAs. At about 1,000 ft. elevation, the fog-heavy breezes which cool the Valley floor don't reach this area, so it can get quite warm. However, nights in the Chiles Valley are cool at this altitude, creating a diurnal shift that greatly benefits the grapes, which include classic Bordeaux varieties. Interestingly, because of the Chiles Valley's relative isolation, many of the earliest vineyards were spared from phylloxera. As such, the AVA is home to some very old zinfandel vines as well. Wineries to try: Volker Eisele , Nichelini Family Winery , Brown Estate Vineyards Covert Estate in Coombsville AVA, Courtesy of Covert Estate Coombsville AVA Napa Valley's newest AVA, Coombsville received appellation status in 2011. This area, in the Southeastern corner of the Napa Valley, is only ten minutes outside of downtown Napa. The weather is cooled significantly by the AVA's proximity to the San Pablo Bay, yielding elegant examples of cabernet sauvignon, syrah, pinot noir and chardonnay. Wineries to try: Ackerman Family Vineyards , Shadybrook Estate , Covert Estate Diamond Mountain AVA While you may not find those sparkling gemstones here, you will find wines made primarily from cabernet sauvignon that are just as stunning. Located in the warmer Northwestern part of the Napa Valley, this region, which gained its AVA status in 2001, was actually named for the shards of reflective volcanic glass found in the soils. First planted in 1868 by Jacob Schram of Schramsberg Vineyards, the region has come to be associated with wines that are structured and plush with unmistakable mountain fruit intensity and great aging potential. Winery to try: Reverie Winery Howell Mountain AVA Located on the Northeastern side of the Vaca Mountains just above St. Helena, this is Napa Valley's first established sub-AVA, and one of the most prestigious. Many celebrate the concentration and signature \u201cwildness\u201d of Howell Mountain wines \u2013 predominantly cabernet sauvignon, as well as merlot, zinfandel, and petite sirah. This distinctive character is a result of the region's warm, dry climate and rocky, porous soils, thanks to its positioning well above the valley floor. Wineries to try: ADAMVS , Clif Family Winery , W.H. Smith Wines , Howell Mountain Vineyards Courtesy of Carneros Wine Alliance Los Carneros AVA The Los Carneros AVA, established in 1983, actually straddles land in both Napa and Sonoma Valleys, making it the first California wine region to be defined by its unique climate as opposed to political boundaries. This is a cool climate appellation heavily influenced by prevailing winds from the San Pablo Bay, with daytime temperatures rarely exceeding 80 degrees. Stunning examples of chardonnay, pinot noir, and sparkling wines, as well as some merlot are produced in Carneros thanks to this distinctly cool climate. Wineries to try: Domaine Carneros , Etude , Cuvaison , Artesa Mount Veeder AVA Formed from an ancient seabed, the Mount Veeder appellation boasts one of the longest growing seasons and the lowest yields in the Napa Valley. It is also the only hillside appellation that adjoins the cool, bayside Carneros. These factors, combined with the steep, rugged conditions that severely limit mechanization, have allowed the region to develop a reputation for intensely concentrated, hand-crafted, and age-worthy wines made from cabernet sauvignon, merlot, zinfandel, and chardonnay. Wineries to try: Fontanella , Mount Veeder Winery , O'Shaughnessy Estate Winery Oak Knoll District AVA This district achieved its AVA status in 2004 as a result of local winemakers' concerted efforts to have the region's cool climate and relatively long growing season recognized. The region boasts Napa Valley's largest alluvial fan \u2013 triangular-shaped deposits that form from water as it descends from the mountains \u2013 which is one of Oak Knoll's defining characteristics. The emerging granular soil forces vines to dig deep in search of water, resulting in small, highly concentrated grapes and elegant, intensely perfumed wines made from the most diverse lineup of grape varieties in the Napa Valley. Wineries to try: Trefethen , Robert Biale , Materra | Cunat Oakville AVA, Courtesy of Facebook: Oakville Winegrowers Oakville AVA Named for the groves of native oak trees that covered the area in the 1800s, Oakville was actually once just a steam train stop in the Napa Valley. Today, wines from Oakville are among some of the most recognized and sought in the world. Marquis names like Opus One, Robert Mondavi, Screaming Eagle, Harlan, and Far Niente have helped create the concept of \u201cCult Cabernet\u201d so synonymous with the Oakville appellation, while other smaller, family-run producers in the area continue to maintain its stellar reputation for world-class wines and hospitality. Wineries to try: Robert Mondavi , Opus One , Far Niente , Cardinale Rutherford AVA Located just North of Oakville as the geographic and historic center of the Napa Valley, and boasting a warm climate moderated by cooling Bay Area fog, Rutherford is a classic Valley floor appellation with vineyards reaching from the base of the Mayacamas to the Silverado Trail. Some of the region's wineries date back to the late 1800s, when wheat was Napa Valley's main crop. Thomas Rutherford, for whom the AVA was named, settled and began planting grapes instead. Today, visitors will find rich, ripe wines made from cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc, and zinfandel, with some sauvignon blanc as well. Wineries to try: Peju , Beaulieu Vineyard , Round Pond Estate Fantesca Estate in Spring Mountain, Courtesy of Fantesca Estate Spring Mountain District AVA Located above St. Helena on the Eastern side of the Mayacamas and connecting with the border of Sonoma County to the North, the region gets its name for the many natural springs that mark the area. Spring Mountain District is rich with history \u2013 it is said that the region's first vineyard, planted in 1874, withstood Prohibition because it was so remote. Today, the challenging mountain terroir yields complex, \u201cintellectual\u201d wines made from Bordeaux varieties as well as other unique grapes like riesling, s\u00e9millon, gew\u00fcrztraminer, and even traditional Portuguese grapes. Wineries to try: Fantesca Estate , Robert Keenan Winery , Smith-Madrone St. Helena AVA Thought of as the birthplace of Napa Valley's commercial wine industry, Napa's oldest wine estate, Charles Krug, was established here in 1861. St. Helena is home to 6,800 planted acres of grapes and 400+ vineyards, more than any other AVA in the Napa Valley. With a warmer climate than other AVAs, the region produces ripe yet structured cabernet sauvignon, merlot, syrah, zinfandel, and sauvignon blanc. The region also organizes an annual wine tasting and food pairing competition called BASH. Wineries to try: Ehlers Estate , Titus Vineyards , Raymond Vineyards , Charles Krug Stags Leap AVA, Courtesy of Facebook: Stags Leap District Wine Growers Stags Leap AVA The potential of this region was cemented when Stag's Leap Wine Cellars' 1973 Cabernet Sauvignon won the infamous Judgment of Paris tasting over more famous wines from Bordeaux. Thought of as a \u201cvalley within a valley,\u201d the appellation is only one mile wide and three miles long and planted with mostly Bordeaux varieties. It's a warm region moderated by cool bay winds at night, with diverse soils that allowed the region to be the first AVA to be approved based on the distinctiveness of its soils. Wineries to try: Cliff Lede Vineyards , Stag's Leap Wine Cellars , Pine Ridge Vineyards , Clos du Val Wild Horse Valley AVA While one of the earliest AVAs to be established, the Wild Horse Valley appellation remains one of Napa Valley's most obscure. In fact, unlike most other Napa Valley AVAs, this region serves as more of an area for growers who supply winemakers with fruit of unique terroir, usually from pinot noir, chardonnay, and syrah, thanks to the cool climate and shallow, volcanic soils. Winery to try: Heron Lake Winery Yountville AVA Not to be confused with the downtown area of Yountville, home to the famous French Laundry, the Yountville AVA has a rich history in Napa. Geourge Yount, for whom the town is named, planted the first vineyards in the region in 1836 in the area that would ultimately become Dominus Estate.

        "text": "It's always a good time to go to Wine Country, but winter can be truly special.

        "title": "New in Napa Valley in 2020: Where To Eat, Stay, Sip & Shop",
        "text": "Napa Valley is the kind of place that never goes stale, for you can visit every year and still discover new places to stay, taste, eat, and shop. From new urban wine tasting rooms you can walk between to a one-stop-shop for R&R and retail therapy, we've made planning your 2020 Napa Valley vacation easy on you. Here are the best new spots to add to your itinerary. Stay The Setting Inn, Courtesy of The Setting Inn / Bob McClenehan If you're seeking a tranquil getaway nestled in the heart of Wine Country, The Setting Inn fits the bill. This renovated, 1901 white farmhouse is a quick drive \u2014 or ride on the property's complimentary electric bicycles \u2014 from the towns of Napa and Yountville . During the rainy winter months, the cozy, oversized rooms with soaking tubs, heated floors, and fireplaces deliver all the warmth you'll need. But when the sun is out, you'll likely want to spend your downtime sipping wine from one of The Setting Inn's many outdoor seating areas, enveloped by vineyards: on your private patio, the communal deck, the grand lawn, or within the chic, indoor/outdoor red barn. Bonus: all guests receive a sit-down tasting of The Setting Wines, which famously sold one of its bottles for $350,000 at a charity auction in 2017. After years of construction, the new Four Seasons Resort and Residences Napa Valley on the edge of downtown Calistoga is finally set to open in 2020, with reservations being accepted as early as July. Expect a pool, spa, multiple dining options, and even a winery, run by top Napa Valley winemaker Thomas River Brown, who's been awarded 23 100-point scores from wine critic Robert Parker throughout his career. Many rooms boast vineyard views and look out at the Palisades Mountains. Wine Tasting Rooms Renewed Cakebread Cellars' hospitality center, Courtesy of Cakebread / Rocco Ceselin Two of Napa Valley's longtime wineries opened stunning new visitor centers at the end of 2019. The iconic Cakebread Cellars in Rutherford has set itself apart from every other Napa Valley winery, for its new hospitality center features nine uniquely-designed tasting rooms, each assigned a different tasting experience. For example, you can opt for a red or white wine-specific tasting within the fermentation hall, surrounded by Cakebread's gorgeous concrete eggs, or a food and wine pairing set in a glass-walled room with a view. In Carneros, the new 5,000-square-foot visitor center at Bouchaine Vineyards rises majestically out of the gorgeous, rolling landscape. Designed like a semi-circle with a wall of windows and an expansive patio (complete with fire pits), the views here give the winery's beloved pinot noirs a run for their money \u2014 and on a cold or rainy day, the interior is incredibly cozy. Napa's New Urban Wineries WALT's Napa tasting room, Courtesy of WALT Wines The buzzing downtown Napa welcomed several new tasting rooms recently. St. Helena \u2018s Alpha Omega Winery opened a second outpost downtown, the Alpha Omega Collective , which also pours wines from its sister brands, Tolosa on the Central Coast and Perinet in Spain. This gives visitors a chance to taste Bordeaux, Burgundian, and Spanish wines all in one place (and even pair them with tasty treats like Spanish fried chicken). Just across the way from the new collective, Napa Valley visitors can finally gain access to the venerable wines from Mayacamas Vineyards. The historic Mt. Veeder winery established in 1889 has always been pretty exclusive and off-the-beaten-path, but the new Mayacamas Downtown tasting room can welcome more people than ever before, both conveniently and at a fraction of the price. Sonoma's WALT Wines has crossed over the border. In 2019, WALT opened a new wine tasting room right across from the Oxbow Public Market , bringing a unique Burgundian tasting experience to Napa. Book the Root 101 tasting to sample 1,000 miles of pinot noir via single-vineyard bottlings sourced up the West Coast \u2014 from Santa Barbara to Oregon's Willamette Valley . Coming soon to downtown Napa is the new Roots Run Deep tasting room, opening in a historic craftsman built in 1901. Here, visitors will be able to sample the winery's affordable Napa Valley wines, including their uber-popular Educated Guess Napa County Cabernet Sauvignon, which retails for about $25. Art & Wine in Napa Valley 1881 Napa, Courtesy of 1881 Napa / Lowell Downey Farther Upvalley and located next door to the legendary Oakville Grocery, 1881 Napa opened inside a beautiful white Victorian built in \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 1881. A tasting room and museum in one, visitors can taste an array of wines from Napa Valley's distinct viticulture appellations (spanning Carneros to Calistoga) while learning all about wine history and how it has evolved in Napa Valley. The museum is free admission, where you can check out wine relics, antiques, and artifacts from Europe and California. In Yountville, the brand new Heron House is a multi-winery tasting room across from the Hotel Villagio . Featuring eight winery partners, including Bench Vineyards, Eponymous Wines, Hobel Wines, Lindstrom Wines, Myriad Cellars, Steltzner Vineyards, Switchback Ridge, and Zeitgeist Cellars, this tasting destination offers much more than just wine, thanks to a curated collection of art, crafts, and gourmet goodies. Elevated Experiences Food pairing at Trefethen, Courtesy of Trefethen Family Vineyards / Robb McDonough Other Napa Valley wineries recently launched original, appointment-only tasting packages, incentivizing visitors to revisit old favorites. Trefethen Family Vineyards now has two food and wine experiences on deck: Taste the Estate and Legacy Tasting. The latter is actually hosted by a third-generation family member, but both incorporate ingredients from the winery's impressive culinary gardens. The tastings pay homage to the Napa Valley Cooking Club, which the Trefethens started in the '70s, welcoming top chefs from all over the world. In celebration of its 80th anniversary, Beaulieu Vineyard has created the Georges de Latour Experience, which honors the winery's most prized reserve wine and Napa Valley's first cult cabernet sauvignon. Taste five different vintages of the Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon spanning several decades and even a barrel sample of a future release. Eat Perry Lang's, Courtesy of Facebook: Perry Lang's Yountville is known for its international fine dining, but a new steakhouse from The Estate Yountville and celebrity grill master chef Adam Perry Lang has arrived to shake things up. Housed in a two-story mansion built in 1870, Perry Lang's dining room is masculine, yet luxurious, and the restaurant menu showcases the chef's dry-aged beef program, which goes up to 400+ days for the Reserve Cut. No time for brunch? If you need a great cup of coffee and grab-n-go breakfast before you head out for a day of wine tasting, make a stop at Station in St. Helena. The latest project from Joel Gott of the famed Gott's Roadside lives in a vintage gas station off Main Street. \u2013 The Best Time of Year to Visit Napa Valley \u2013 \u2013 The 10 Best Napa Valley Wine Country Resorts \u2013 Author Jess Lander Jess Lander is a freelance wine, food and travel writer based in Napa Valley and exploring all things California wine country.

        "title": "SENSES by JCB: A Destination of the Senses",
        "text": "UPDATE: Unfortunately, Senses by JCB is permanently closed Close your eyes and envision your perfect Napa Valley day. Does it involve fine wine, gourmet food, pampering at the spa, followed by a little boutique shopping? Thanks to SENSES by JCB, all of that is now totally possible within one small block of Yountville . Equal parts spa, fashion boutique, beauty shop, and fragrance emporium, SENSES is the latest luxury offering from Jean-Charles Boisset (JCB), proprietor of St. Helena's Raymond Vineyards and also the JCB Tasting Salon , Salon Priv\u00e9 , and Atelier Fine Foods \u2013 all located in the JCB Village off Washington Street in Yountville. \u201c[JCB] wanted to make this a whole day experience for people to go through the entire village and tap into every market they're looking for,\u201d said Austin Dahn, Assistant Manager for SENSES by JCB. \u201cYou'd typically have to go to different places throughout the day to get that full experience.\u201d Moreover, with the holiday season upon us, SENSES is also a one-stop-shop for luxury brands and gifts for everyone on your list (while you treat yourself, of course). We've sprinkled our top suggestions throughout so that you can do Santa's work in one fell swoop. Hit the Spa On the second floor of SENSES is the medi-spa, a bright, white, and luxurious space that's perfect for some rest and relaxation, but is not your typical Napa Valley day spa. You won't find any massage options on the menu, but you will find qualified and intensely-trained aestheticians who offer waxing, eyelash extensions, and lash and brow tinting. At SENSES, facials are the specialty with 12 different types on offer, aimed at reducing signs of aging, sun damage, controlling acne, and more. The SENSES spa is hyper-focused on quality, utilizing the best, medical-grade products and equipment \u2013 from microdermabrasion to microcurrent technology \u2013 to perform the most advanced and cutting edge treatments. It's one of the few places in Wine Country to offer the hydrafacial, which extracts, exfoliates, and rejuvenates with a high-tech wand. All of the spa treatments are designed to produce long-lasting effects and in many cases, instant results. Downstairs, there's a beauty room carrying both medical-grade and organic skincare lines. The iS Clinical products, for instance, are especially exclusive; only five percent of their distribution can be to non-medical offices, one of those being SENSES. What to gift: Book mom an age-defying facial or non-surgical facelift. Treat your husband or dad to the curated Gentleman's Facial. Create Your Own Perfume Blend SENSES carries a wide array of high-end perfumes, including two made by Jean-Charles himself, but it also offers the opportunity to create your own signature scent. Sit down at the interactive perfume organ, a display of base scents that mimics the workstation of a nose (another word for perfumer). Take a whiff of individual scents to get a feel for how they come together to make a single fragrance. The next step is the blending experience, where you'll blend base fragrances with essences of your choice and go home with your own custom bottle of perfume. What to gift: Book the perfume blending experience for you and mom, your sister, or a friend \u2013 it'll make for a perfect girls day activity. Or, create your own unique blend for yourself or gift the bottle to someone special. Get Ready for a Night Out in Yountville Always impeccably dressed, JCB hands down has the best fashion sense in Napa, not to mention the California wine industry, and the retail portion of SENSES reflects his exquisite taste. With the exception of shoes, SENSES has everything you need to style yourself for a fun night out in Napa Valley. Start by shopping for designer threads (for both men and women), which have been hand-selected from luxury fashion brands, mainly based in New York and Paris. If you've always wanted a fancy fur coat, this is the place to splurge on your dream one. Next, accessorize. SENSES has a vintage handbag wall \u2013 look for the giant unicorn head \u2013 featuring unique, limited-edition pieces from the most in vogue 90s brands (Gucci, Louis Vuitton), all priced below market value. The boutique also carries new luxury handbags and jewelry pieces to complete any outfit. What to gift: Purchase a gift card and allow the recipient to pick something chic out for themselves, or choose a vintage handbag for them to unwrap. They'll likely be the only one around town carrying that purse. The Full Napa Valley Experience Located within the JCB Village, you can spend a full day here indulging in the ultimate Napa Valley experience. Before or after your spa treatment, sit down for a tasting of sparkling and still wines while you shop for luxury goods at the JCB Tasting Salon , a one-of-a-kind tasting room and retail store featuring custom-designed jewelry, candles, and more. Or, for a more private experience, book an appointment at Salon Priv\u00e9 . Nosh throughout the day on epicurean delicacies sourced from all over the world \u2013 from caviar to truffles to an impressive international cheese selection \u2013 at Atelier Fine Foods . When it's time to go out for the evening, Yountville's incredible fine dining establishments and resorts are all within easy walking distance. What to gift: A bottle of sparkling wine from the JCB Tasting Salon and a tin of caviar from Atelier make for a killer combo. Gift this to the host of your holiday party.

        "title": "Louis M. Martini's Slow Braised Short Ribs",
        "text": "Now that fall is officially here, we're looking for every excuse to get in the kitchen and whip up something comforting and delicious. Luckily for us here in Wine Country, we don't have to look too hard for inspiration, thanks to the plentiful seasonal fruits and vegetables and the acclaimed restaurants and wineries offering the best in food and wine. To help you get inspired in the kitchen, too, Chef Jeffery Russell of Louis M. Martini Winery in Napa Valley is sharing his mouth-watering recipe for Slow Braised Short Ribs fit for the season. It's loaded with meat, herbs, and vegetables, and served over perfectly cooked al dente rigatoni pasta. Pair it with the recently released Louis M. Martini Cypress Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon and we can bet this tasty meal is one you'll want to make again and again this season. Bon appetit! Slow Braised Short Ribs Makes 4 servings Wine Pairing: Cypress Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon Ingredients: 1 lb Short Ribs, Sinew and Fat Removed \u00bc c Extra Virgin Olive Oil 3 c Veal Stock 1 ea Medium Yellow Onion, Diced 1 ea Medium Carrot, Peeled & Diced 3 ea Celery Stalks 6 ea Garlic Cloves, Smashed \u00bd c Pecorino Cheese, Grated 2 T Oregano Leaves, Chopped 1 lb Rigatoni Pasta, Cooked Al Dente 4 T Butter, Sweet Cream, Unsalted TT Salt & Pepper Directions: Heat olive oil over high heat in dutch oven. Season short ribs with salt and pepper and sear in hot oil until color develops on both sides. Add onion, carrot, and celery to the pan and reduce heat to low. Sweat vegetables until they are aromatic. Add garlic and stock, then cover dutch oven and place in oven at 300\u02da for 2 hours, or until short ribs are soft. Carefully remove short ribs from braising liquid and strain off vegetables. Pull the short ribs apart into small pieces with two forks. Place cooked vegetables in a blender with a little bit of the braising liquid and puree until smooth. Combine puree with remaining liquid and mix well. Toss cooked rigatoni with the short ribs, braising liquid and puree, add butter and half of the pecorino, followed by the oregano. Spoon the mixture into serving dishes and sprinkle with remaining pecorino. To experience Chef Jeffery Russell's cooking, you don't want to miss the Underground Cellar Experience at the newly restored winery. The seven-course pairing is anchored by a stunning collection, with small-lot releases from the iconic Monte Rosso Vineyard and library vintages of the heralded Lot No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon, providing an abundance of aromas, tastes, and textures for Chef Russell to build upon.

        "title": "Experience Fantesca Estate & Winery With These Special Events",
        "text": "More than just revered for its world-class wines, Napa Valley is legendary for its warm hospitality. This authentic, welcoming atmosphere always comes from the true passion for wine of the people behind the estates; no one exemplifies this more than Susan and Duane Hoff, founders of Fantesca Estate & Winery . Love and Wine Susan and Duane met in college, when Susan was working for her small family business, Sound of Music. The small electronic chain quickly grew and Duane soon joined the family business, which became known as Best Buy. The duo continued to grow with the company and held executive positions at the Minneapolis-based operation. By 2004, The Hoffs were ready for a new chapter; they fell in love with a 53-acre estate in the Spring Mountain AVA of Napa, which they purchased and named Fantesca Estate & Winery. The Making of a Superstar Team The Hoffs realized they had something special in their Spring Mountain estate and knew they needed a highly skilled winemaker to bring out the full potential of this Napa Valley site. They tapped famed winemaker Heidi Barrett to join Fantesca in 2008. Barrett, who came to the estate after her tenure at Screaming Eagle, brings her deft touch to the estate cabernet sauvignon and the All Great Things Red Blend, as well as Fantesca's Russian River Sonoma Chardonnay. Fantesca continued to build its superstar team when former sommelier and wine expert DLynn Proctor joined as Winery Director in 2018. One of the stars of the wine documentary SOMM , which follows aspiring professionals on their journeys to become Master Sommeliers, Proctor was also a finalist in The Cha\u00eene des R\u00f4tisseurs Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mondiale du Vin \u201cBest Sommelier in America Competition.\u201d The Estate On the Spring Mountain estate resides an elegant winery, tasting deck, olive trees, and a honey bee hive, where the winery produces small batches of jams and honey as gifts during the holiday season. In addition, a spectacular mountainside cave, believed to be an abandoned silver mine, creates a naturally temperature-regulated resting home for aging wines and hosting playful barrel sample tastings. Fantesca's 10-acre Spring Mountain vineyard is home to cabernet sauvignon and petit verdot. Various blocks of different expositions and soil types give their estate wines a beautiful complexity and elegance. Originally planted in the 1860s as part of Caroline Bale's dowry to Charles Krug, the site is that of Napa royalty. The Wines When thinking about which wines to produce, the Hoffs knew they wanted to stay very focused on a limited selection to craft the highest-caliber wines. From the Fantesca vineyard comes two of Fantesca's signature wines: the Spring Mountain cabernet sauvignon and the All Great Things Red Blend. In Russian River Valley, the focus turns to elegant chardonnay and King Richard's Reserve, a compelling pinot noir. Events As Fantesca continued to grow and garner accolades, the Hoffs felt strongly about creating special tasting experiences for their collectors; today, events are central to Fantesca's ethos. Over the next few months, several unique events give visitors the opportunity to intimately explore the wines beyond the tasting room. 9 Stars Culinary Experience Wednesday, November 13 \u2013 Saturday, November 16, 2019 An extraordinary gastronomic experience, 9 Stars gives guests a memorable tour of three of the Hoff's favorite Three Michelin-starred restaurants. The first evening, participants will enjoy an 11-course tasting menu at Sonoma's much-buzzed about SingleThread , helmed by acclaimed chef Kyle Connaughton, followed by an evening stay and breakfast the following morning at the SingleThread Inn. That day, Susan and Duane Hoff, along with vineyard owner Pam Bacigalupi, will provide a tour of Bacigalupi Vineyard , and the subsequent tasting at Fantesca Estate and Winery will bring the vineyard experience full-circle. After, the group will settle into their accommodations at Meadowood Napa Valley . Dinner that evening will be at the revered The Restaurant at Meadowood with chef Christopher Kostow, along with sommelier-guided pairings. The next day, a private jet will escort diners to New York City, where a completely different vibe awaits. After a night's rest at the The Pierre and a day of free time to explore the city, the event will culminate at Le Bernardin for the final, memorable Michelin-starred dinner. Mardi Gras in New Orleans Thursday, February 20 \u2013 Sunday, February 23, 2020 There's no other celebration like Mardi Gras; for Susan and Duane Hoff, who were were honored as King and Queen of the Krewe of Mid-City in 2017, the f\u00eate holds special meaning. The Fantesca couple will host guests for four days during the beloved celebration, starting with dinner at famed restaurant R'evolution. The following evening's Bal Masque is one of the most elegant affairs of the weekend; party-goers will dine and dance at this formal event. The celebration culminates with the big parade, where revelers will ride the Fantesca float during the procession. Kentucky Derby in Louisville, KY Friday, May 1 \u2013 Saturday, May 2, 2020 The thrill of the races can get anyone's heart pounding and the Hoffs bring the magic up close with their Kentucky Derby experience. The VIP suite is located right on Millionaires' Row, offering optimal views of the action. In-suite hospitality, VIP Fast Track passes, and gift bags will complete this exciting viewing party.

        "title": "1881 Napa: A Taste of History",
        "text": "Napa Valley may be one of the most well-known wine growing regions in the world, but many people aren't aware of how many distinct sub-appellations the region actually has \u2014 16, in case you're wondering. And, while Napa is well-suited to growing a variety of grapes, there's no denying that Napa Valley is cabernet country, with cabernet being the most widely planted grape in the region. In a perfect world, we'd spend an entire month (or more!) exploring what makes Napa Valley cabernet what it is, from the varying microclimates to the diverse soils. However, since that's not the most realistic approach for most, there's now a simpler solution thanks to 1881 Napa . Located in the heart of Napa Valley in the tiny town of Oakville , 1881 Napa is a new wine tasting room dedicated to appellation-designate cabernet sauvignon bottlings under their label of the same name, using fruit sourced from some of the most prestigious vineyards throughout Napa Valley. Offering cabernet sauvignon from Napa Valley's distinct growing areas, a visit to 1881 Napa is a rare opportunity to taste the varying characteristics that Napa Valley cabernet can display, from savory and smoky to rich and fruit forward. Even more, each of the tastings are designed to be educational and exploratory, so everyone who visits can get a better understanding of what makes this area ideal for growing cabernet. Regardless of which tasting experience you choose, you're bound to learn something new while you sip. There's a comparison tasting featuring two wines from two cooler AVAs and two from much warmer AVAs, as well as a tasting option that dives deeper into the flavors and nuances of cabernet from Napa's mountainside vineyards versus those grown on the valley floor. Another tasting experience allows you to ponder how texture and tannin feel on the palate to grasp why these components are vital in cabernet wines, while the tasting known as \u201cOpposites Attract\u201d explores four extremely different AVAs to let you sample a full range of cabernet expressions. Visitors can even \u201cEmbark on a Journey Throughout the Valley\u201d and taste cabernets from 12 different sub-appellations, an experience that would take days to do anywhere else! Housed in a landmark Victorian house built from 1874 to 1877, 1881 Napa takes its name from the year the adjacent Oakville Grocery was founded, a store that happens to be California's longest continuously operating grocery. To pay homage to this history and the significance of California's early wine days, the historic home has been completely reimagined as a modern tasting salon and museum. As the first wine museum in Napa Valley, 1881 Napa showcases wine artifacts and relics from the 19th century, a collection of antique wine decanters, and information on Napa's early wine pioneers. Adding to the space is a 48-light Baccarat crystal Zenith chandelier that hangs below a reproduction of an 1895 map of Napa County on canvas, making for a striking contrast between old and new. After a bit of wine and education at 1881 Napa, be sure to stop into Oakville Grocery next door to load up on sandwiches and Wine Country picnic fare, then pinch yourself for having had the opportunity to experience so much history and wine all in one place. 1881 Napa is truly a must-stop for wine lovers looking to brush up on Napa Valley's history and for those looking to discover the dramatically different expressions of cabernet from Napa Valley.

        "title": "Burgess Cellars: An Exceptional Howell Mountain Experience",
        "text": "Close to St. Helena , but off the beaten path on the side of Howell Mountain, you can find the quintessential Napa Valley winery experience at Burgess Cellars . This family-owned gem offers generous hospitality, exceptional and highly-rated wines, and sweeping views that span from the city of Napa all the way up to Calistoga . History & Family Always enamored by the beauty of Napa Valley, pilot Tom Burgess came to the region in the 1970s to explore the vineyards for sale. He selected the most interesting of the six available: a hillside vineyard on Howell Mountain planted in the 1880s by Swiss-Italian immigrants. In 1972, this purchase was far ahead of the curve of development in the Napa Valley; at the time there were only 20 other wineries and California had not yet gained its acceptance onto the world stage for wine. Tom didn't come to Napa Valley because it was famous, he was one of the pioneers who made it famous. This history is still lauded by the winery, and Tom's son Steven Burgess now holds the reins. From the pen and ink label depicting the vineyard in 1972 to the winery's logo being a copy of Tom's father's signature, you can find family dedication in all aspects of the winery. They continue the tradition of only making wines from hillside fruit from the original 1880 Estate Vineyard and their Haymaker Vineyard on the Eastern side of Howell Mountain, as well as a chardonnay from the second-generation, family-owned Burnside Road Vineyard in Sonoma County (also located on a hillside, naturally). The 1880 Estate Vineyard is planted with cabernet, cabernet franc, and zinfandel \u2014 a recent addition harkening back to the vineyard's original plantings \u2014 while the Haymaker vineyard boasts cabernet, syrah, petite sirah, petit verdot, and malbec. Howell Mountain The dedication to hillside fruit isn't just to pay homage to Burgess Cellars' history, but to also showcase the unique terroir of Howell Mountain \u2014 an area that looms above the fog line with many unique microclimates that contribute to cooler days and warmer evenings instead of the more exaggerated heat spikes common to the valley floor. The result is consistently rich, ripe fruit with bold structure, elegant tannins, and concentrated flavor. Though the appellation sees more rainfall than those on the valley floor, the soil is rocky and drains well, meaning it retains less moisture, resulting in smaller berries and more concentrated flavor. This also affects the barrel selection winemaker Kelly Woods uses on these wines. Because the wine is already so structured from the mountain tannins, she opts instead for mostly neutral barrels, only using 20% new oak barrels to elevate aromas. Winemaking Kelly started at Burgess Cellars with the 2013 vintage, bringing her expertise in both vineyard and winemaking processes. She sees herself as a steward of the land and the wines, allowing the terroir and vineyard to shine instead of manipulating the winemaking. She makes decisions of when to pick the fruit row by row instead of large blocks at a time and keeps every lot separate until the wine is ready to be blended for bottling. This allows Kelly to fine-tune the process, understanding that every vine develops and expresses itself differently. The goal is to make the wine in the vineyard, meaning every decision in the vineyard is made to protect the integrity of the final wine. This also leads to incredibly age-worthy wines, as evidenced by their extensive library collection. Mountainside Tasting The winery holds back a few hundred cases of wine each vintage for its library, not to be released until at least 10 years have passed. If you have a special date you're looking for, the winery has mostly everything from 1980 to their current release available for purchase. If you are wanting to try the current 10-year library wine and current release Reserve Cabernet (the 2009 and 2013, respectively, at the time of this writing), treat yourself to the by-appointment-only Mountainside Tasting experience, a semi-private, seated 90-minute wine exploration. During this tasting, you'll learn about the history of Burgess Cellars and Howell Mountain and discuss the nuances of the winemaking, all while taking in the panoramic vista to better understand what makes mountainside wines so special. You'll start your tasting with a sip of ros\u00e9 from the view deck, allowing for an opportunity to savor the views before heading to the cellar for the 2016 Chardonnay. From the mountainside tasting room, you'll enjoy the current release small production and reserve wines, such as their richly complex Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon \u2014 a quintessential expression of the Howell Mountain appellation \u2014 or the elegant Estate Mountaineer Blend, a reserve that is made looking at the vineyards as a whole. Completing the tasting is a sample of the 2009 library wine, the perfect way to experience the evolution of wine. As you contemplate the nuances of your perfectly-aged glass, take a moment to enjoy the sweeping views. The room is set right into the vineyard and has a magical view of the Napa Valley from north to south, providing amazing context of the geography of the region and the unique position of Burgess Cellars. Burgess Cellars' library program is not only a fun new way to discover wine, it's a true rarity in the Napa Valley. Each wine tells a different chapter in the history of Napa Valley, so if there's a particular vintage not included in the tasting that piques your interest, you can purchase a bottle to explore as part of the tasting. Just because the wine is bottled doesn't mean its evolution and development is complete, which gives you reason to revisit these library wines time and time again and always find something new to enjoy. Tasting in the Cellar To experience the classic barrel room at Burgess Cellars, be sure to make a reservation for the 60-minute Tasting in the Cellar. This tasting allows you to enjoy Burgess Cellars' wines in the active barrel cellar surrounded by their display of vintage bottles and a museum wall that shows the history of Burgess Cellars and the Howell Mountain vineyards. During the tasting, your host will guide you through the history of the winery and innovations in winemaking. You'll listen and sip on a selection of delightful wines, such as their Ros\u00e9 of Syrah from the Haymaker Vineyard and current release Hillside Cabernet Sauvignon, a blend of grapes from the 1880 Estate Vineyard and Haymaker that perfectly encapsulates what makes this mountain appellation so special. Single vineyard bottlings are often included in this tasting, made only when Kelly feels the wine deserves to be on its own stage. No matter which tasting experience you reserve, the team at Burgess Cellars is sure to make you feel welcome to their mountainside oasis. The views cannot be beat and the wines showcase the mountain distinction of this Howell Mountain gem. Tom Burgess was often quoted as saying, \u201cbetter lucky than good,\u201d and while he may have been lucky to find this jewel on Howell Mountain, everything about Burgess Cellars \u2014 from the people to the views, and of course, the wine \u2014 is not just good, it's exceptional. 1108 Deer Park Road, Deer Park, CA 94576, (707) 963-4766 Images Courtesy of Burgess Cellars \u2013 Explore Howell Mountain Wineries in 2 Days \u2013 \u2013 Ultimate Guide to St. Helena \u2013 Author Laura Bunting Laura Bunting is a Sonoma County native who enjoys exploring and sharing all things wine country.

        "title": "Tasting at Louis M. Martini's Newly Renovated Winery",
        "text": "Louis M. Martini Winery in St. Helena impresses as soon as you set foot onto the historic property. As you stroll up the landscaped walkway, exceptionally grand red doors sweep open to welcome you to the beautifully furnished and newly remodeled tasting room. The winery, originally built in 1933, recently underwent a massive facelift that modernized the space while also paying homage to its historic roots. This Napa Valley icon hosts multiple tasting experiences, from an introductory tasting at the Crown Bar to the intimate Underground Cellar Experience, offering an exquisite something for every palate. Heritage Lounge Tasting Heritage Lounge Enjoy the art of wine and food For the foodies, the Heritage Lounge Tasting cannot be missed. This guided, seated tasting offers perfectly paired bites with each wine. Executive Chef Jeffrey Russell brings his fine-dining background to the new culinary program at Louis M. Martini. His nuanced flavors and unexpected pairings are the perfect complement to Winemaker Michael Eddy's award-winning wines. From ash roasted beets with golden raisin and almond agrodolce to crispy pig ears with Caciocavallo cheese and charred treviso to the unexpectedly delightful pink peppercorn panna cotta, each pairing highlights the flavors in the wines. The menu changes seasonally, so you'll likely get to enjoy a whole new experience upon your next visit. Chef Russell hails from an illustrious career in high-end dining establishments from New York to Napa Valley. His creativity in leading this cutting-edge culinary program is evident in his exceptional creations that complement Martini's cabernet sauvignon-led collection. Winemaker Eddy is especially known for his hands-on crafting of their signature cabernet sauvignon wines. Under the tutelage of Michael Martini, grandson of founder Louis M. Martini, Eddy spent over a decade honing his skills and becoming deeply acquainted with the wine and the historic vineyards from which they source the grapes. The collaboration between the wine and food allows each element to shine and truly enhances the overall tasting experience. Heritage Room tasting experience The tasting itself offers a selection of small-lot wines from the famed Monte Rosso Vineyard in the Moon Mountain AVA of Sonoma County. This iconic 575-acre vineyard sits atop the Mayacamas Mountains with 250 acres of planted vines. Named for its distinct Red Hill Loam\u00a0soil, the iron-rich volcanic soil imparts a special \u201cMonte Rosso Spice\u201d to the wines' distinct flavors, namely, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger. In this experience, your winery host not only guides you through the wine pairings, but also educates you on the fascinating intricacies of vineyard sites, soils, and winemaking and aging techniques, as well as how everything works together to produce outstanding wines. While many people know Louis M. Martini for its balanced cabernet sauvignon, the wines in this Heritage Lounge flight also include cabernet franc, malbec, the Mountain Red Blend, and a Gnarly Vine Zinfandel. Each wine \u2014 with the exception of the Mountain Red \u2014 is 100% of its designated varietal, which truly allows the characteristics of this exceptional vineyard to shine through. The Underground Cellar Experience The Underground Cellar Experience Savor history, wine, and culinary creations For those looking for an even more exclusive experience, The Underground Cellar Experience is not to be missed. It takes you below ground into the winery's 85-year-old barrel cellar to learn about the history of the winery and the Martini family's old-world heritage. The original cellar offers two private libraries for seated tastings and a genuine bank vault that Louis Martini purchased from a bank going out of business in San Francisco. You'll taste small-lot wines alongside delicious culinary creations. To visit the cellar without the food pairings, check out the Historic Tour & Tasting, which highlights the history of the property, the influence of the Martini family on the development of the Napa Valley, and the wine that earned a coveted 100 points from Robert Parker's Wine Advocate. Outdoor Cabana Tasting Martini Park* Al fresco charm fit for groups For a more casual experience, spend your afternoon lounging in Martini Park, which is open Thursday through Sunday until 6 pm. This relaxed al fresco environment allows you to taste your way through three wines with culinary pairings or purchase a bottle and kick back with friends. Private cabanas dot the grassy courtyard and can be reserved for four-hour windows \u2014 they seat up to 12 people. Wood-fired pizzas, spit-roasted meats, and more are available to pair with your wine. Crown Bar Tasting Crown Bar An intro to Martini wines without a reservation If you're not into reservations, you can visit the Crown Tasting Bar without any advanced planning. Located at the heart of the newly renovated winery, the Crown Bar introduces you to the Louis M. Martini portfolio from both Sonoma County and Napa Valley. Here you can taste a range of their most well-loved wines, such as their refreshing Napa Valley Ros\u00e9 of Cabernet Sauvignon and classic Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon, alongside some small-lot selections. Dining room at Louis M. Martini No matter which tasting option you select, your visit to Louis M. Martini Winery is sure to be unforgettable. This Napa Valley favorite offers the best blend of history, modern innovation, and world-class wines that all showcase the bounty of Napa Valley and Sonoma County. Images courtesy of Louis M.

        "title": "The Best Kid-Friendly Wineries in Napa Valley",
        "text": "Wine tasting is decidedly a very adult thing to do in that, well, legally you have to be an adult to do it. However, despite the age requirement, there are a few Napa Valley wineries that understand some families enjoy traveling together in Wine Country and therefore happily accommodate children. In fact, some Napa wineries go out of their way to ensure that, if parents want to bring their kids, the younger set will actually have as much fun as the adults. Many wineries even allow kids to accompany adults on the more adventurous tours and tastings (so those under age aren't just stuck in a wine cellar for an hour). Read on for some of the best family-friendly wineries in Napa where you and your kids will have a great time, and you can spend all of that babysitter money you'll save on a case of wine to take home and enjoy later. Beringer Vineyards Courtesy of Beringer Vineyards Adults love visiting Beringer because it's the oldest continuously operating winery in Napa Valley; kids love it because they can explore the 17-room mansion that is the centerpiece of the property, play bocce ball, and enjoy a picnic lunch in the garden. Children of all ages are also welcome on the 30-minute Legacy Cave Tour that takes visitors through the Old Winery and historic tunnels that were dug into the hillside by Chinese laborers who had just finished constructing the transcontinental railroad. Wine tasting and a chance for kids to learn a little history \u2014 can't go wrong with that. 2000 Main Street, St. Helena , CA 94574, (707) 257-5771 Frog's Leap Winery Courtesy of Facebook: Frog's Leap Winery Kids (and dogs on leashes) will love exploring this working farm where they'll get to meet chickens, try to spot frogs in the fish pond, and roam gorgeous gardens that serve as both scenery and habitat. The Garden/Cellar Tasting is the best option for people with children as it's the most casual tasting available: you can either stroll through the gardens while you taste or hang out in the Barrel Cellar while the non-wine tasters sip on juice boxes and color. 8815 Conn Creek Road, Rutherford , CA 94573, (707) 963-4704 Honig Vineyard and Winery Courtesy of Honig Vineyard and Winery Kids are welcome on the Eco Tour + Tasting Experience at Honig, which includes a guided tour in a six-person cart (perfect for tired little feet) where you'll all learn about the things that Honig does to take care of the environment, including how the Honig bees help, before finishing with a tasting. The winery is so kid-friendly, in fact, that during the tasting, kids can enjoy juice and snacks, play with toys and puzzles, color in coloring books, or even grab some sidewalk chalk and make art for everyone to enjoy. 850 Rutherford Road, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 963-5618 Inglenook Courtesy of Inglenook Children 12 and over are allowed to join the Inglenook Experience Tour and Tasting, which includes a walking tour of the chateau, vineyards, and infinity caves, and finishes with a seated wine and cheese tasting in a private room, but for a truly family-friendly experience, skip that in favor of a more casual experience at The Bistro. There, you can dine outside in the courtyard and enjoy wines by the glass or bottle, as well as soft drinks, coffee, bistro bites, cheese, and charcuterie. While the adults sip and chat, the kids can borrow wooden sailboats to sail in the courtyard fountain, a la the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris, which the Inglenook gardens were inspired by. 1991 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 968-1161 Castello di Amorosa Courtesy of Castello di Amorosa What kid (or grownup for that matter) doesn't love a castle? Castello di Amorosa is an authentically-styled 13th century Tuscan castle winery that has 107 rooms, five towers, a moat with a drawbridge, courtyards, beautifully vaulted wine cellars, and even a torture chamber. Of course, that's not all on display, but you will see a lot of the wine cellars and caves on the guided tour that allows children (over five), who get a cup of grape juice during the wine tasting portion. If you don't think your kids are up for an hour-long walking tour followed by 45 minutes of wine tasting, or if they're five or under, skip that part and explore the property (where you may spot sheep, emus, and peacocks) and the two main levels on your own. All \u201cwell-behaved and well-supervised\u201d kids are allowed on the grounds for a general admission price of $20 (also includes grape juice). There are even coloring books and a kids' table provided in the Knight's Hall tasting room so your little ones can stay entertained while you taste. 4045 St. Helena Highway, Calistoga , CA 94515, (707) 967-6272 \u2013 Napa Valley Family Vacation: Where to Stay, Eat, and Play \u2013 \u2013 Best Dog-Friendly Hotels in Napa Valley \u2013 Author Daisy Barringer Daisy Barringer is a freelance writer who grew up in San Francisco and now lives there with her 150-pound Saint Bernard, Monkey.

        "title": "Unexpected Napa \u2014 A Unique Experience at JaM Cellars",
        "text": "Typically, when people think of Napa, they think of the picturesque landscape \u2014 sprawling estates with rolling hills, orderly vines of every varietal, the morning sun burning off the gray mist that blankets the valley. There is much to love about that heavenly slice of Wine Country. But recently, I stopped through downtown Napa to visit JaM Cellars , which offers an unexpected taste of Napa Valley. Centrally located on First Street, next door to Andaz Napa and sister brand John Anthony Vineyards , it's also a stone's throw away from local restaurants such as Eiko's Sushi , Grace's Table , and Charlie Palmer Steak in the ultra-chic Archer Hotel . Upon stepping through JaM Cellars' doors, it was immediately apparent that this was not like any other Wine Country tasting room that I'd been to. Like all Napa and Sonoma tasting rooms, JaM was well proportioned and thoughtfully decorated. Unexpectedly though, this tasting room had walls that were papered with old Rolling Stones covers, a live band setup, an incredible vinyl collection, Eames lounge chairs, and an honest-to-goodness recording studio in the back. It may sound gimmicky at first blush, like a Hard Rock Cafe of Wine Country, but it wasn't \u2014 the people I met there were as excited about music and community as they were about wine. The result of the d\u00e9cor and the easy personalities I encountered at JaM Cellars all contributed to the relaxed, intimate, and (perhaps most importantly) non-intimidating vibe in which to try wine \u2014 an unexpected experience in Napa Valley. Anyone who's been wine tasting knows, the conversations that happen are often about flavor profiles, vineyards, barrels, and the aging process. While there's something to be said for understanding what you're drinking, sometimes I just want to hang out and drink great wine, and get to know the people pouring on a human level in addition to learning about the wine. With JaM, the focus is on creating a refreshing environment where people can enjoy their wines while surrounded by their friends, whether that is in a lounge-like setting with an acoustic rock show going on, or during a progressive pop synth show with dancing under the sparkling disco ball. Owen Ridings, the wine and music studio manager at JaM Cellars, was on site to greet me when I arrived early on Sunday. Dressed in jeans, a dark cardigan, Chuck Taylors, and black-framed specs, he seemed less like a traditional Napa Valley wine manager and more like an indie bookshop owner or the singer-slash-guitarist of a band (the latter of which turned out to actually be true). But still, he did know a lot about wine. We reclined on couches around a glass coffee table, with a perfect view out the airy front windows of downtown Napa. Ridings took out their hugely-popular Butter Chardonnay and did a side-by-side pour of two appellations \u2014 one chardonnay made from a range of California growers' grapes and the other from exclusively Napa Valley grapes, which is only available at their Wine and Music Studio. In between our conversations about their record collection, podcasts, and the accessibility of wine, I learned to taste the difference. The education was dispensed in such a way that I remembered words like \u2018rich' and \u2018creamy' and was completely comfortable admitting \u2014 in an environment so laid-back \u2014 that I couldn't detect the hints of baked lemon or vanilla. As we tasted and chatted, Ridings went on to share more about the story behind the wine. I learned that wines produced exclusively from Napa Valley vineyards vary from year to year. Napa Valley exists in a unique microclimate, and fluctuations in that microclimate affect that season's crops. And since wine designated from a certain Napa Valley appellation means that wine is exclusively grown, harvested, aged, and bottled in Napa Valley, the sum of all those microclimate changes are compounded in that end product \u2014 the bottle of wine. The result can sometimes be devastating when Napa Valley suffers unseasonable weather or a natural disaster, but when things go well, as they do more often than not, wines produced in Napa Valley can be more vibrant and aromatic than those from elsewhere in California. Not all vintners can source from some of the best growers in Napa Valley, but the team behind JaM Cellars has a long history here in Wine Country. The owners, husband-and-wife team John and Michele Truchard (the \u2018J' and \u2018M' of JaM Cellars), are second-generation Napa Valley vintners. With the success of their high-end John Anthony Vineyards already under their belt, John wanted to create great wine for the everyday drinker. I was surprised to learn that the JaM label was created during the recession in the aughts, but I shouldn't have been \u2014 people always want quality, affordable wine. John relies on his long-standing relationships with growers to control the entire vertical process of winemaking, creating a quality wine at a reasonable price, then distributes through popular markets and grocery stores. (I've since found JaM's handy WineFinder on their website, JaMCellars.com, that shows you everywhere you can find their wines around the country). We moved onto the California Candy Dry Ros\u00e9. Named for its eye-candy appeal, this wine is as pretty as it is delicious \u2014 perfectly crisp and clean on a warm spring morning in Wine Country. Next, Ridings poured the Napa and California JaM Cabernets while I asked him about the studio itself. What's it like to work in this space? A part shop, part live music venue where the owners have consciously moved away from what can sometimes be the sterile grandeur of tasting rooms of yore. He details anecdotes of his favorite memories: guests who geek out over the vinyl collection, the reaction from the crowd when the giant disco ball is turned on, sourcing local talent for intimate shows during one of their JaMSessions, and bringing the community together with late night events (there's not usually much open in Wine Country after dinnertime, but JaM Cellars is open until 10pm most nights and until midnight on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings). In short, his favorite moments are the ones that are about the people and their stories; that everyone happens to be enjoying great wine is the cherry on top. Those moments come in the tastings at JaM Cellars, but also on a larger scale at festivals such as BottleRock Napa Valley, among others. As the presenting sponsor of BottleRock, they host the JaMPad, which features intimate shows and DJ dance parties between sets. Their special California Candy Fros\u00e9 was a hit last year in the toasty Napa Valley sunshine, so here's to hoping they'll bring that back. For a brand that has dispensed with the pretension and stuffiness, and embraced all the fun and bringing-togetherness aspects, a frozen ros\u00e9 isn't blasphemous \u2014 it's irreverent, welcoming, and fun, just like tasting at JaM Cellars, and just like how creating a memory around delicious wine should be.

        "title": "Napa Valley Hot Air Balloon Rides: What to Know Before You Go",
        "text": "Napa Valley can be explored by bus, bike, segway, and even tuk tuk, but none of those modes of transportation can compete with the mountain and vineyard views you'll enjoy \u2014 and the photos you'll capture \u2014 from an adventurous, sunrise hot air balloon ride. Soaring over Napa Valley at up to 3,000 feet is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that should be at the top of your Wine Country bucket list, so here's everything you need to know before you lift off. What to expect when you're\u2026flying Hot air balloon rides take place very early in the morning, for that's when the winds are calmest. You will be up before sunrise. The good news is that you'll literally get to rise with it; the lighting is truly incredible and it won't cut into your wine tasting plans for the day. Some companies offer transportation to and from your hotel and also provide coffee and tea upon arrival. Each balloon company takes off at a different spot throughout Napa Valley, so you may want to choose based on your hotel location (anything for a few extra minutes of sleep, right?). Your hot air balloon experience will typically last between three to four hours, but the actual flight duration is roughly one hour, give or take. Hot air balloon rides are unpredictable and completely dependent on that day's flying conditions. Most experiences have the option to add on a post-flight, sit-down brunch, complete with sparkling wine. Note: Hot air ballooning is not recommended \u2014 and sometimes not permitted \u2014 for infants and young children (kids must be 48 inches in height or at least six years old), women who are pregnant, or persons with pain, disability, or injury, for you'll need to be able to stand in the balloon. Cost A hot air balloon ride is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, which unfortunately means it doesn't come cheap. Standard flights start at $200+ per person. Thinking of popping the question? A private flight will cost you $2,000+, but your effort will most certainly be rewarded with a \u201cYes!\u201d Courtesy of Napa Valley Balloons When to book Hot air balloon rides are weather dependent and it's not uncommon for them to get cancelled due to rain, heavy fog, or strong winds. Safety is of the utmost importance and the company you book through will call you the morning of if it's cancelled and then usually give you the option to rebook for the next day. Some companies also have additional Northern California lift-off locations outside of Napa Valley that you can take advantage of in the result of cancellation. The best strategy is to schedule your balloon ride at the beginning of your Napa Valley trip, that way you have the rest of it to keep rescheduling in the case of inclement weather. Last minute reservations are often available, but to be safe, book a few weeks in advance, especially if it's during peak tourist season (August \u2013 October). Courtesy of Napa Valley Balloons What to wear and pack Layers, layer, layers. Napa Valley has chilly mornings, so no matter the time of year, you'll want to dress in layers for your ride. In winter it can be downright frigid, sometimes down to the 30s and 40s, in which case you may want to bring a hat, scarf, and gloves. The coldest part of the experience is on the ground before take off. During the flight, the burners that go off in the basket every so often help keep passengers warm. Sunglasses can help lessen the sun's rays as it rises and it's advised women don't wear dresses or skirts, as they have to climb over the basket to get in and out (plus, wind, duh). Your camera is probably the single most important item to bring. One with a strap is ideal, for obvious reasons. Where to Book Most of Napa Valley's hot air balloon companies have been around since the 1970s and 80s and were not only flying some of the first balloon rides in Napa Valley, but also in the entire country. They offer competitive pricing, but slightly different packages and experiences. You really can't go wrong, but here are a couple to consider: Napa Valley Aloft Owned and continually-operated by the Kimball Family, Aloft maxes out their passenger count at 12, so you'll likely get a more intimate experience than some other balloon companies. The standard Aloft balloon ride is $250 per person, but they also offer private flights for two people (starting at $2,000). A post-flight champagne breakfast will cost an extra $28 per person. If you're worried about a possible cancellation, Napa Valley Aloft is a good company to roll the dice with. Though they typically launch out of Yountville at V Marketplace, they have access to a secondary launch location in the secluded Pope Valley, which is prone to less fog than other parts of the valley. Napa Valley Balloons, Inc. This is the only company that launches from an actual winery. The standard package price is $275 per person, which includes the balloon flight and free round-trip transportation, but they also offer a hot air balloon ride with a Napa winery tour included (starting at $394 per person). A private flight and brunch for two guests costs $2,200 and the company also offers a slew of wine and hotel packages to help customize your Napa Valley visit. If you're staying Upvalley (like St. Helena or Calistoga ) you might consider booking with their partner company, Calistoga Balloons . A private flight for two will cost you $2,200. \u2013 Napa Valley's Top 7 Bucket List To-Do's \u2013 \u2013 The Most Luxurious Hotels in Napa Valley \u2013 Author Jess Lander Jess Lander is a freelance wine, food and travel writer based in Napa Valley and exploring all things California wine country.

        "title": "Napa's Newest Destination: Louis M. Martini Winery",
        "text": "With a historic past dating back to the repeal of Prohibition, Louis M. Martini Winery is certainly not a new fixture in the Napa Valley wine scene. But as the saying goes, everything old can be new again, and such is the case for Louis M. Martini. After having recently undergone extensive renovations to reveal a brand new look and variety of tasting experiences, this storied Napa Valley winery suddenly feels \u201cnew\u201d again, and we're sharing all the details on its shiny new space. A Storied Past Located in St. Helena , Louis M. Martini Winery was one of the first wineries in Napa Valley after Prohibition ended, founded in 1933 by Italian immigrant, Louis M. Martini. Known for his innovation and collaboration both in and out of the winery, Louis M. Martini went on to establish the winery as one of the foremost producers of cabernet sauvignon in Napa Valley, and today, Louis M. Martini Winery remains true to its roots. A New Era Building on the legacy started in 1933, Louis M. Martini's new Visitor Center offers world-class wine paired with welcoming hospitality. Designed by renowned Wine Country architect, Howard Backen, the facility's extraordinary new spaces are meant to inspire and connect, while rich tasting experiences celebrate 85 years of winemaking and help guests explore the nuances of these iconic Napa Valley wines. Crown Bar At the Crown Bar, the epicenter of the main tasting room, a 30-foot by 60-foot glass wall frames the space, offering tasters a look into the winery's expansive oak barrel room. At the Founders Room and the Heritage Lounge, indoor and outdoor spaces provide ideal settings for more immersive wine and food pairings, such as customized library tastings and vineyard perspective tastings, served alongside food pairings from Executive Chef Jeffery Russell. Outside, guests can enjoy private caba\u00f1as with bottle service at Martini Park, offering an acre of public and private spaces, but for something truly unique, a tour and tasting in the 85-year-old Underground Cellar makes for a memorable way to experience the vast history of the winery. Tasting Experiences Crown Bar Tasting Available daily, the Crown Bar Tasting is a great way to get acquainted with the wines of Louis M. Martini, which includes a flight of well-known wines and small-lot releases. Heritage Lounge Tasting Inside the Heritage Lounge or out on the Terrace (weather permitting), guests can enjoy a seated tasting experience that features the winery's famed Monte Rosso Collection and Lot No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon, along with a delicious assortment of culinary bites. Library Tasting Taking place in the private Founders Room, this customized, seated tasting for up to ten people highlights the impact of vintage on a wine. Led by a personal sommelier, each of the wines are selected based on personal interest, and include library wines and barrel samples. Historic Tour & Tasting This guided tour and tasting highlights the historical significance of Louis M. Martini.

        "title": "Best Craft Breweries and Distilleries in Napa and Sonoma",
        "text": "Wine isn't the only wonderful, carefully crafted drink worth imbibing while visiting Wine Country. A little known fact about Napa Valley and Sonoma County is that there are several artisan distilleries and small-batch breweries also available for tours and tastings (and some that offer bites to go with those libations). If you're looking for a bit of a break from vino on your next visit, here are the best local brews and craft spirits with which to tempt your palate. A Bustling Brewery at Oxbow Fieldwork Brewing Courtesy of Fieldwork Brewing Founded in Berkeley, CA, this local brewery has a beautiful taproom in the bustling Oxbow Public Market in downtown Napa . Fieldwork Brewing features a rotating tap list of fresh releases, which can be enjoyed by sampler flight, by the glass, or to-go in growlers and Crowler cans. They don't serve food here, but with the myriad of options from other top-notch vendors in the Oxbow Market, you'll have plenty to choose from to pair with your drinks. 610 First Street, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 266-1582 Speakeasy Spirits Napa Valley Distillery Courtesy of KQED The first distillery to open its doors in Napa Valley since the end of Prohibition, this family-owned and operated distillery offers educational distillery tours, followed by tastings of flights of their award-winning products. With two locations for you to choose from, you can customize your craft spirit experience. Transport yourself back to the Roaring Twenties with a tasting at the Grand Tasting Salon, which is one part art deco speakeasy, one part tiki room, and all parts tasty spirits and education. A tour and tasting is $30 per person, and reservations are required, so be sure to book early. If you're already headed to Oxbow Public Market (where there is no shortage of options for food, drink, and people watching), visit Napa Valley Distillery's tasting bar, replete with mahogany wood vibes and brandies galore. A tasting flight is $15, and don't forget to check out their bitters collection \u2014 the largest collection on the West Coast. Grand Tasting Salon: 2485 Stockton Street, Napa, California 94559, (707) 265-6272 Tasting Bar at Oxbow Public Market: 601 First Street, Suite 8, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 226-9269 Grape-Based Organic Vodka Hanson of Sonoma Distillery Courtesy of Nat and Cody Grantz / Hanson Distillery This family-owned craft distillery in Sonoma focuses on creating organic, grape-based, gluten-free, and non-GMO vodka. Typically, vodka today is made from sorghum, corn, rice, rye, or wheat. Hanson Vodka is made from grapes, which means the distillery turns grapes into wine, and then wine into vodka (the perfect fit for vodka made in Wine Country). Their infused vodkas are flavored with real, organic ingredients, and feature flavors such as cucumber, ginger, mandarin, haba\u00f1ero, boysenberry, and espresso. Reserve a spot in a vodka tasting, cocktail tasting, martini and caviar pairing, or try their introduction to mixology course with Hanson craft cocktails. Best of all, you get to taste in their beautiful, spacious tasting room, amid a library of color-coordinated vodka bottles. 22985 Burndale Road, Sonoma, CA 95476, (707) 343-1805 SoCal Craft Brews in Napa Stone Brewing Courtesy of Stone Brewing What started as a small microbrewery in San Diego in 1996 has these days turned into one of the largest craft breweries in the United States. Their Napa brewery features a menu full of craft beers and eclectic food items, which patrons can enjoy both indoors and out with a view of the Napa River. Order a flight for the outdoor patio at sunset, and maybe a dish or two, such as the Stone's Impossible Burger, a plant-based burger that will make you forget you're not eating meat. Need a little probiotic with your beer? Try the popular Boochcraft, flavored with grapefruit and hibiscus. 930 Third Street, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 252-2337 Urban Winery Meets Vegan-Friendly Brews St. Clair Brown Winery & Brewery Courtesy of St. Clair Brown Winery & Brewery This boutique urban winery, nano-brewery, and culinary garden is located right in the heart of downtown Napa. The brews are made on-site in small batches, featuring 13 different offerings of beer, with more developing all the time. The beers tend to be unfiltered and more malt-driven, favoring a less bitter or \u2018hopped' profile for friendlier food pairings. And vegans, rejoice! With the exception of their Honey Wheat Ale, all other brew offerings are vegan. For those ready to take their beer love to the next level, St. Clair Brown recently started their own Beer Boot Camp, where you can learn tastes and semantics at a technical beer tasting, enjoy a three-course beer paired lunch, and brew beer with Brewmaster Elaine St. Clair herself. 816 Vallejo Street, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 225-5591 A Taste of Italy in a Bottle Prohibition Spirits Courtesy of Facebook: Prohibition Spirits For a truly unique tasting experience, head over to Prohibition Spirits in Sonoma to try some of their Italian craft spirits. Tucked into the picturesque Cornerstone Sonoma , Prohibition Spirits is known for their award-winning Limoncello (an Italian lemon liquor), but also offers tastings of their other speciality spirits, such as their gins, rums, and whiskeys. The Groth husband and wife team fell in love while exploring Sonoma, then decided they wanted to bring Limoncello (what they affectionately term \u2018sunshine in a bottle') to Wine Country. So they moved from Boulder, CO to Sonoma County and started producing California's first organic Limoncello. Prohibition Spirits offers group tastings (a six spirit tasting goes for $20) and mixology classes, as well as private events held in a beautiful courtyard. It's truly a family venture \u2014 their daughter produces a line of olive oils, balsamic vinegars, and soy candles, also available for purchase in the shop. After your tasting, spend some time in the nearby Cornerstone and Sunset gardens \u2014 admission is complimentary and all gardens are open to the public. 23592 Arnold Drive, Sonoma, CA 95476, \u200b(707) 933-7507 Unique Libations in Santa Rosa Cooperage Brewing Company Courtesy of Cooperage Brewing Company Brewer and founder Tyler Smith likes to focus on variety at Santa Rosa's Cooperage Brewing Company, experimenting with different yeasts, hops, bacteria, and barrel types to develop unique libations. Take your time sipping and tasting here; there's a giant projector screen (usually playing live sports games) for your viewing pleasure, but if that's not your speed, there are also plenty of board games on hand to make a few beers with friends even more enjoyable. 981 Airway Ct., Suite G, Santa Rosa, CA 95403, (707) 293-9787 Small-Batch Old School Whiskey Sonoma Distilling Company Courtesy of Michael Woolsey / Sonoma Distilling Company Whiskey maker and Bay Area native Adam Spiegel found his passion for creating spirits while assisting a distiller friend. He's honed his skills throughout the years, first from making beer, then wine, and eventually distillation to found Sonoma Distilling Company in 2010, one of the first 200 distilleries in the United States. The tastings feature their in-house selection of American whiskeys and ryes, which are of a more traditional style of whiskey \u2014 the result of their \u201cold school\u201d way of double distilling in handmade copper pot stills (smaller batches with more flavor). Several are available year round, but there are a few seasonal specialties to look out for, released just once a year, like the cherrywood rye whiskey in the spring and the Distiller's Edition cherrywood smoked bourbon whiskey in the fall. 5535 State Farm Drive, Rohnert Park, CA 94928, (707) 583-7753 Post Up With Your Pup Lagunitas Brewing Company Courtesy of Lagunitas Brewing Company A local favorite, this Petaluma establishment has a huge, ever-rotating selection of sours, ciders, ales, and stouts. Post up in their taproom or nab one of the many picnic tables outdoors. It's pet-friendly, so there's usually a handful of dogs enjoying the sun while their humans listen to the live music in the beer garden. And with a food menu of nachos, burgers, chicken wings, and other tasty pub fare, you could easily while away an afternoon here. In fact, we recommend it. 1280 North McDowell Boulevard, Petaluma, CA 94954, (707) 778-8776 Locally-Made Brews & Bites Tannery Bend Beerworks Photo courtesy of Kali Maire Kirschman / Tannery Bend Beerworks Located in Napa's historic Tannery Row, Tannery Bend feels like the great local spot to grab a casual beer after work or spend a sunny Sunday afternoon. The sandwiches and snacks are prepared in-house and (of course) feature perfect items to pair with a brew. For those settling in to watch a sports game or catch up with friends, we have two words for you: bottomless popcorn. 101 South Coombs Street, Suite X, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 681-5774 Northern California in a Bottle (and Can) Fogbelt Brewing Company Courtesy of Fogbelt Brewing Company This craft brewery and gastro-pub celebrates the North Coast and even names each of their beers after a prominent coastal Redwood tree only found in the \u2018fog belt' \u2014 the area along the Northern California coast that's typically covered in fog, which produces a unique ecosystem. In addition to the stately brews that are available on tap, Fogbelt Brewing Company also hosts regular events, with a monthly food and beer pairing featuring a new line-up each month. And in May 2019, they'll also be throwing Barrelrock, the Fogbelt Brewery Parking Lot Party, which will feature a mini music festival, special beer releases, and outdoor barbeque. 1305 A Cleveland Avenue, Santa Rosa, CA 95401, (707)978-3400 \u2013 8 Must-Stay Downtown Napa Hotels \u2013 \u2013 What's New in Napa Valley in 2019 \u2013 Author Julia Chang Julia Chang is a writer based out of San Francisco, California.

        "title": "Your Go-To Guide To Napa Valley Wedding Venues",
        "text": "Dreaming of a Napa Valley wedding? The first step in your planning is finding the right venue, which may sound overwhelming given the hundreds of wineries in Napa Valley. While Sonoma may have plenty of winery options for your nuptials, Napa is a bit more limited, offering only a handful of choices (though all stunning). If you're open to other ideas, it's just a matter of focusing on what elements will make your big day perfect for you and your guests. The good news is if you know what you're looking for \u2014 and how much you can afford \u2014 it's pretty easy to narrow down your options and find the right fit. From luxury resorts to restaurants to surprising alternative venues, here is our go-to guide to finding the best Napa Valley wedding venue for you. Historic Winery Wedding Carriage House at Charles Krug, Courtesy of Charles Krug In addition to coveted permits allowing weddings, Napa Valley's winery venues share rich, century-old history, giving each a romantic, old world vibe. If that's what you're looking for, it's just a matter of comparing perks and prices. At Charles Krug , Napa's oldest winery, couples can host a grand outdoor wedding for up to 800, between April and October, on The Great Lawn under the property's majestic heritage oaks. Or, choose to celebrate in the renovated carriage house, which dates back to 1881, but know you'll have a hard stop at 10pm. V. Sattui \u2018s site fee includes multiple venues for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception, until 11pm, as well as exclusive portrait access in the vineyards and winery tower. With over 60 varietals of wine to choose from and an in-house Michelin-starred chef handling catering, couples can count on a premium Napa-style food and wine experience. For more intimate winery weddings, Merryvale Vineyards in St. Helena offers ceremony and reception venues, including their stunning cask room, where guests can dine between two stories of gigantic, century-old wine barrels. Further north, nestled in the Mayacamas Mountains between the Sonoma and Napa County lines, Hans Fahden Vineyards is a hidden gem with an idyllic garden setting and wine cave for dinner and dancing. Resort Weddings Courtesy of Silverado Resort and Spa Couples looking for all-inclusive packages or those planning a destination wedding should consider one of the many resort locales throughout the valley. In addition to vineyard backdrops and sometimes even wine caves, resort weddings can offer all the feels of a Napa Valley wedding, along with the ease of in-house catering, bar service, accommodations, and flexibility that many couples and their guests are seeking. Silverado Resort and Spa lures wedding parties with its golf and spa packages, but it sets itself apart by specializing in Indian weddings, offering three-night celebration packages that blend tradition, ritual, and culture. The Meritage Resort & Spa and The Westin Verasa are two more great options for larger-scale weddings, with a plethora of site options for ceremonies and receptions. For a high-touch, luxury wedding, Solage Calistoga offers extensive menu options and modern lodging in their cabanas and cottages. Nearby, Indian Springs Resort & Spa recently started allowing intimate weddings for up to 85 guests on their peaceful grounds, while weddings at Harvest Inn in St. Helena include a beautiful vineyard backdrop perfect for outdoor receptions under the stars. Tucked inside a private canyon against a wooded backdrop, Calistoga Ranch is an elegant, understated luxury venue option with outdoor ceremony sites and a magnificent wine cave for receptions. And at Carneros Resort and Spa , couples can choose from an intimate elopement package paired with dinner at their FARM restaurant or host a wedding for up to 175. For the ultimate in Wine Country luxury, Meadowood weddings are comprised of exceptional food and wine, seamless service, and picturesque venue options for celebrations of two to two-hundred. With activities like croquet and craft cocktail classes for wedding party weekends, and spacious, luxury bridal party lodges, this resort venue sets a new standard for Wine Country weddings. Food-Driven Weddings Courtesy of Carolin Winata / Harvest Inn For foodie couples hoping to infuse the best of Napa Valley's farm fresh cuisine into their big day, there are several great options that will guarantee a memorable wedding feast. Serious foodies will revel in a wedding at CIA at Copia , the world-renowned culinary school's downtown Napa branch. In lieu of a pricey site fee, the venue charges per person for their assortment of catering packages, with customizable add-ons for options like bar service and menu extras, giving couples a lot of flexibility to tailor every detail to suit their needs. Longtime Napa favorite, Brix Restaurant , offers both the setting \u2014 a stunning backdrop of the Mayacamas Mountains with acres of vineyards and gardens \u2014 and bountiful menus of farm-to-table California fare at a much more affordable price tag than most. At The Charter Oak , couples can buy out the entire restaurant, getting access to both indoor and outdoor spaces, along with the acclaimed Meadowood chef's hearth-driven cooking. Set up for everything from elopements to 300-person rustic Wine Country weddings, Farmstead at Long Meadow Ranch offers picturesque lawn and garden settings for vows, along with a dedicated barn space for dancing and receptions where guests can indulge in top-notch, organic American farmhouse cuisine. Unexpected Venues Courtesy of Napa Valley Wine Train If resorts, wineries, and restaurants don't quite fit the bill or the budget, one of these Napa Valley venues might surprise you. Whether you're inviting guests for your ceremony and reception or you're planning on eloping, set your marriage in motion aboard the Napa Valley Wine Train. Catering packages and changing scenic views of the valley make this a one-of-a-kind destination wedding option. For slightly more affordable options, Churchill Manor and River Terrace Inn , both located in downtown Napa, offer classic Wine Country weddings and elopements. Or, for couples looking for a flexible venue that lets you dance and drink until midnight, The Chardonnay Golf Club is a beautiful spot that won't break the bank. \u2013 How to Choose a Wedding Photographer \u2013 \u2013 Your Guide to Planning a Napa Valley Bachelorette Party \u2013 Author Susan Williams Susan Williams is a baker, writer and entrepreneur based in Sonoma, California.

        "title": "One-Day Napa Valley Cabernet Tasting Itinerary",
        "text": "Every year, people from all over the world flock to Napa Valley for its beautiful scenery, stately wineries, and acclaimed dining scene. And when it comes to wine, Napa Valley has it in spades, delivering something for every type of wine lover, whether novice or enthusiast, collector or cult-wine seeker. While Napa grows several different grape varieties, there's no denying that the most coveted grape \u2014 and the one that really put Napa Valley on the map \u2014 is none other than cabernet sauvignon. We've teamed up with some of our winery partners to explore what makes Napa cabernet so special, why this Northern California wine region has become synonymous with cabernet, and where to taste a few stellar examples. Cabernet Country Courtesy of Eva Fan / Unsplash You'd be hard pressed to find a wine lover who hasn't tasted a Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon at least once. After all, the vast majority of Napa's wineries offer one or more cabernet or cabernet-based Bordeaux blends. Plus, it's easy to find a plethora of Napa cabernets on the shelves of wine shops and grocery stores around the country. The region has a climate, soil types, and growing season suited to cabernet, and over 20,000 acres of cabernet dominates Napa Valley's total 46,000 acres under vine, but this wasn't always the case. Judgement of Paris It really wasn't until the 1970s that Napa Valley proved they were serious players in the wine world, thanks to what is referred to as the \u201cJudgement of Paris\u201d in 1976. This private wine competition in Paris pitted current releases of Bordeaux and Napa wines against each other in a blind tasting, judged by several top French wine professionals. At the time, wines from California were considered by many to be inferior to those from Europe, especially amongst the French. But at this event, the California wines beat our their French competitors, to everyone's amazement, and changed the game for California wine. Napa Valley Cabernet Courtesy of Beringer Vineyards Cabernet may have originated in France, but wine lovers everywhere have come to adore cabernet from Napa Valley, from its dark fruit profile and oak-influence to its distinct dusty characters and ageing potential. While each producer may have their own style, whether they opt for more or less fruit-forward flavors or take an opulent or restrained approach, many cabernets from Napa Valley have a similar profile. You'll find fruit characters of black currant, black cherry, and ripe plum, herbal notes like mint or eucalyptus, oak influences like vanilla, clove, cedar, and tobacco, great depth of flavor, and firm to well-integrated tannins providing structure for aging. Where to Taste While you could pretty much toss a coin and land on a great Napa cabernet producer, a visit to these four partner wineries makes for a fun cabernet-focused, one-day itinerary through Napa Valley: Stags' Leap Winery Courtesy of Stags' Leap Winery Located in the heart of the Stags Leap District off the Silverado Trail is Stags' Leap Winery, where a winemaking heritage dates back to 1893. This prestigious area not only churns out exceptional cabernets, known for their silky texture, supple tannins, and expressive character, but it is also a beautiful part of Napa Valley. Stags' Leap Winery follows suit, consisting of a picturesque 19th century stone winery and an impressive portfolio of cabernets. Make an appointment for the Heritage Library Tasting to sample some of the back vintage cabernet wines that have helped define this historic estate. 6150 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 257-5790 Beaulieu Vineyard Tasting experience, Courtesy of Beaulieu Vineyard Beaulieu Vineyard, or \u201cBV\u201d as it's called for short, is located about 15 minutes north of Stags' Leap Winery in the town of Rutherford. The Rutherford appellation has nearly two-thirds of its total vineyard acreage dedicated to cabernet sauvignon, and BV's cabernets have become a benchmark for this iconic grape. A stop at this historic winery, established in 1900, is a must for any cabernet fan, who will appreciate the Cabernet Collector Tasting, featuring five current release and rare older vintage wines served in the winery's Reserve Room. 1960 St. Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA 94573, (707) 257-5749 Beringer Vineyards Courtesy of Beringer Vineyards Just five miles north of BV, outside the town of St. Helena on Highway 128, you'll find Beringer Vineyards. Established in 1876, Beringer Vineyards is California's oldest continuously operating winery and surely one of Napa's most recognized labels. As the first winery to give public tours in 1934, you can image that Beringer's hospitality tradition continues today, offering several tasting options tailored to every taste. While the standard tasting or cave tour won't disappoint, cabernet drinkers may want to spring for the From One Five Years To Another tasting experience, which celebrates Beringer's iconic Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon. You'll taste through bottlings spanning 15 years, starting with the 2000 vintage and ending with the critically-acclaimed current release 2015 vintage. 2000 Main Street, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 257-5771 Sterling Vineyards Aerial tram, Courtesy of Sterling Vineyards Further north on Highway 128 is the popular, hill-top winery, Sterling Vineyards. Founded in 1964, the winery is modeled after the famous architecture of Mykonos, Greece, complete with bells that ring every 15 minutes. At 300 feet above the valley floor, the winery is accessible via an aerial tram, and once at the top, you'll find scenic views and a variety of tasting experiences to choose from. The winery specializes in Bordeaux varietals, but for a cabernet-focused tasting, be sure to reserve the Platinum Experience, featuring a flight of four small production reserve and single-vineyard wines paired with a series of delectable bites prepared in-house. 1111 Dunaweal Lane, Calistoga, CA 94515, (800) 726-6136 \u2013 The 10 Best Napa Valley Wine Country Resorts \u2013 \u2013 How to Experience France in Napa Valley \u2013 Author Hana-Lee Sedgwick Hana-Lee Sedgwick is a writer and editor based in Santa Barbara, California.

        "title": "What's New in Napa Valley in 2019",
        "text": "The best part about Napa Valley is that even if you've visited several times before, it's impossible to get bored. There are always new wineries to discover, hotels and resorts to bliss out at, and world-class restaurants to indulge your inner foodie. If a trip to Napa Valley is on your 2019 travel bucket list \u2013 and if not, it probably should be \u2013 here are all the new ways to experience this world-famous, California Wine Country destination. Stay Deluxe King Room, Courtesy of Will Pryce / Hotel Villagio The newest luxury addition to Napa Valley hotels is Hotel Villagio . Formerly Villagio Inn & Spa , this property in the heart of Yountville has undergone a major renovation. The Villagio 2.0 boasts a ton of amenities: a new spa (one of the largest in Napa Valley), a social-focused lobby with craft cocktails, pool table, and classy board games, a heated pool, outside fire pits, and an epic, European-style continental breakfast served until 11 every morning. Hotel Villagio rooms are spacious, warm, and cozy (perfect for a winter getaway) with thoughtful details, like a champagne bucket set next to the soaking tub. Completed this past summer, the Tuscan-inspired Vista Collina resort in Napa is a Wine Country destination in itself. Just steps away from your room (book one with vineyard views) is The Village , a pedestrian district with eight wine tasting rooms, a brewery, upscale grocery, Food & Wine Center (where you can take cooking classes), and an event lawn that hosts artisan markets, live music, and more. The Village is open later than most tasting rooms, so feel free to schedule a few hours in one of the resort's luxury poolside cabanas or a facial at Spa Terra , housed inside a 22,000-square-foot cave. In Calistoga , a boutique inn has opened in a gorgeous stone building that formerly housed the Calistoga Hospital. The historic 1886 building sat vacant for 50 years before the new owners stepped in to restore it and give it new life as The Francis House . Five cozy and uniquely different rooms feature stone walls, antique furnishings, and marbled bathrooms, and your stay boasts other amenities such as a pool, patio garden, and fully-equipped kitchen. The hotel is also right downtown and within walking distance to Calistoga restaurants, shops, and wine tasting rooms. Taste Courtesy of Clos Du Val Two of Napa Valley's most historic wineries got huge makeovers recently. ZD Wines , which celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2018 and is still family owned today, updated their tasting room with floor-to-ceiling indoor/outdoor glass walls and a second-story deck that looks out at the Mayacamas Mountains. Phase II of their renovations, which includes additional private tasting areas, will finish up early this year. Clos du Val , founded in 1972, also incorporated glass walls in their gorgeous new visitor center, which offers killer views of their estate vineyards and the chance to sip wine outside on a nice day. Local designer Erin Martin repurposed staves from the winery's old casks to cloak the walls and ceiling. In March, the iconic Louis M. Martini Winery will join ZD and Clos to Val with the opening of their new winery following a major restoration. Established in 1933, Martini was one of the first wineries to open in Napa Valley following the repeal of Prohibition and their new, contemporary facility in St. Helena looks absolutely stunning with posh, indoor and outdoor spaces offering curated wine and food experiences. Asian Bites and Bubbles Pairing, Courtesy of Facebook: Domaine Carneros Several other Napa Valley wineries recently launched elevated tasting packages, incentivizing visitors to revisit old favorites. Sparkling wine lovers will want to check out Domaine Carneros \u2018 Asian-themed bites and bubbles experience, offered in Jardin d'Hiver, their brand new, all-glass garden conservatory, Domaine Chandon's Brunch in Bloom, a delicious bubbly and breakfast endeavor in Yountville, or the uber-fancy Bubbles & Caviar tasting at Davies Vineyards (you'll get a whole ounce of caviar). Looking for something unique? One of only two Napa Valley wineries with its very own olive oil mill, Round Pond Estate's new Vino and Olio offering is a two-hour, deep dive into how olive oil is harvested and made, culminating in a wine and olive oil tasting paired with small bites. Courtesy of Facebook: Chimney Rock Chimney Rock , located in the renowned Stags Leap wine region, has three new experiences to try, but we're most excited about the Vineyards Odyssey Tour & Tasting, an adventurous, 90-minute vineyard exploration. Courtesy of Prisoner Wine Company By far the most controversial and talked about addition to Napa Valley is The Prisoner Wine Company tasting room, located in St. Helena . The antithesis to the typical Napa Valley vibe, The Prisoner \u2013 made famous for their namesake cult red blend \u2013 is dark, moody, and unlike any other tasting room in Wine Country. You'll have to see for yourself, but one of the most interesting pieces of this new winery is The Makery, a multi-purpose space that supports local artisans in their craft, like pottery, jewelry, and even wine-infused jelly. As for the wine, you'll get to taste a lot more than the typical Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon. Dine Courtesy of RH Yountville After four years of construction and anticipation, Restoration Hardware has finally arrived in downtown Yountville with the brand's first-ever standalone restaurant and wine tasting room. RH Yountville serves up California-inspired comfort cuisine, like truffle grilled cheese and burrata with tomatoes on garlic bread, in a truly magical setting. The dining room features 100-year-old oak trees, antique fountains, and sparkling chandeliers. Moreover, the RH campus has design galleries, a wine and coffee bar, and the Wine Vault, a tasting room and outdoor courtyard that offers three flights of small-lot wines. Shop Makers Market, Courtesy of First Street Napa A big part of downtown Napa's recent revitalization is First Street Napa , home to the Archer Hotel , restaurants, wine tasting rooms, and a high-end shopping district. Recently joining the likes of LUSH Cosmetics, Tommy Bahama, and others is Lululemon Athletica, MacBella (featuring European fashion brands), and Makers Market , where you can pick up locally-made artisan goods. \u2013 The Village at Vista Collina: Napa Valley's Newest Hotspot \u2013 \u2013 The Best Time of the Year to Visit Napa Valley \u2013 Author Jess Lander Jess Lander is a freelance wine, food and travel writer based in Napa Valley and exploring all things California wine country.

        "text": "Once the grapes have been picked and the latest vintage is resting in tanks, the majority of tourists bid adieu to the Silverado Trail, and Calistoga becomes a quieter place. Although it sounds almost counterintuitive, winter is one of the best times to visit Calistoga's various wineries, as the craziness of harvest has wrapped and tasting rooms have a bit more elbow room. While you can easily book a tour or pop into a tasting room on your own terms, a fun way to visit Calistoga's diverse wineries this season is through the Winter in the Wineries Passport . From December 1, 2018 through February 3, 2019, the $60 passport gives you access to free tastings at wineries, as well as discounts at Calistoga businesses and hotels. Avoid the winter blues.

Smith Wines Once you've checked into your hotel, W.H. Smith Wines in downtown Calistoga is the perfect way to get acquainted with the town and the area's wines. Owner Bill Smith was one of the leaders in the creation of the Howell Mountain AVA, and his cabernets from the area exemplify why the region was deemed worthy of its own designation. Insider Tip: Prep your olfactory senses with The Wine Sensory Experience, a guided seminar that helps guests learn to better identify aromas and flavors in wine. 1367 Lincoln Avenue, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-1194 Castello di Amorosa Courtesy of Castello di Amorosa The majestic Tuscan-inspired 13th century castle was built as an homage to 4th generation winemaker Dario Sattui's Italian heritage and is a sight to behold amidst the Napa Valley landscape. Here, sangiovese grows alongside some of Calistoga's popular varieties in the picturesque vineyards, another nod to the winery's Italian roots. Insider Tip: Castello di Amorosa partners with local Napa Valley restaurants to offer free corkage for Amorosa's wines. Purchase a bottle to bring to dinner later that evening. 4045 North Saint Helena Hwy, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 967-6272 Day 2 Sterling Vineyards Gondola at Sterling Vineyards, Courtesy of Sterling Vineyards TEMPORARILY CLOSED \u2013 Next, swing over to another classic producer: Sterling Vineyards. Take in the wintry landscape and picturesque winery \u2014 the architecture emulates the style found in Mykonos, where founder Peter Newton used to live \u2014 as you ride to the top on their aerial tram. Built to transport staff and guests to the winery without impacting the hill, the gondola offers some of the best views of the area. Insider Tip: Make sure to taste the merlot; Sterling claims their 1969 vintage was the first vintage-dated, single varietal merlot in all of California (previously it was only regarded as a blending grape). 1111 Dunaweal Lane, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-3344 Tank Garage Winery Courtesy of Tank Garage Winery End your day by doing a complete 180, style-wise. Tank Garage Winery, located in a converted 1930s gas station, experiments with pet-nats, skin-fermented whites, funky blends (sangiovese and gew\u00fcrztraminer, anyone?) and cool, eye-catching labels \u2014 a total antithesis to the established classical producers of the area. Insider Tip: Although tastings take place at their Lubrication Bar, ask to see the secret back room. This velvet wallpaper-lined speakeasy is normally reserved for Wine Club members, but if you ask nicely, they may let you have a peek. 1020 Foothill Boulevard, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-8265 Day 3 Clos Pegase Courtesy of Clos Pegase Created by renowned architect Michael Graves, Clos Pegase offers another unique, design-centric environment for enjoying Calistoga's range of wines. The winery sources from their four estate vineyards, which total 450 acres, where classic Bordeaux varieties as well as pinot noir are the focus. Insider Tip: While most wineries offer vineyard tours, as Clos Pegase does too, their winter-friendly Connoisseur Cave Tour experience takes guests through their underground caves, ending with a wine and charcuterie tasting in the Cave Theater. 1060 Dunaweal Lane, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-4981 Madrigal Family Winery Courtesy of Facebook: Madrigal Family Winery Winemaker Chris Madrigal's grandparents were one of the first Mexican families to settle in the upper part of Napa Valley when they arrived in the 1930s. Their farming influenced Chris' father, who started cultivating wine grapes, and third generation Chris established Madrigal Family Winery in 1995. Petit sirah is a specialty here, as is cabernet sauvignon. Insider Tip: Just because the weather isn't cooperating doesn't mean you can't have a picnic. The winery's Calistoga Lifestyle Winery Lunch experience \u2014 complete with a wine tasting \u2014 moves into the winemaking facility during inclement weather. 3718 North St. Helena Hwy, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-8619 Tamber Bey Entrance, Courtesy of Tamber Bey Make new friends of the four-legged variety at Tamber Bey, which is situated in the middle of an equestrian training facility and sanctuary. The tour not only covers the winemaking facility but the ranch as well, where guests can see the horses up close (up to 45 of them reside on the property). Insider tip: Skip the cheese: Tamber Bey offers a pairing of savory cookies with their wines. 1251 Tubbs Lane, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-2100 Calistoga's diverse wine experiences don't hibernate once winter comes. There's plenty to see, do, and taste in the colder months, especially when taking advantage of the tasting passport.

        "title": "How To Read a Napa Valley AVA Wine Label",
        "text": "When selecting a bottle of Napa Valley wine do you scrutinize the label looking for a clue as to its quality? Or, other than making sure it's a wine varietal that you like, are you solely attracted by the eye-catching design? No need to feel confused the next time you reach for a Napa Valley wine, because we're here to help you decode what's inside. With our handy guide to deciphering a Napa Valley AVA wine label, you'll soon realize it's full of useful information to help guide you. To be able to use the exclusive Napa Valley AVA (American Viticultural Area) designation, which also includes its 16 sub-appellations, 100% of the grapes must be from the AVA. In fact, everything on a wine label is there for a reason. Most items are required by law, but a few are more or less marketing ploys. Let's dive a little deeper. Napa Valley AVA In the Napa Valley AVA, over 34 different grape varieties are grown in a sliver of valley 30 miles long and only up to 5 miles across at its widest point. Cabernet sauvignon grapes make up 40% of the total wine production, with chardonnay grapes coming in second favoring the clay soils and cooler climates within the sub-AVAs. The elevations in the AVA range from sea level to 2,600 feet, and feature a mostly Mediterranean climate, but certain sub-AVAs are cooled by ocean currents and fog, creating a diverse grape-growing opportunity. TTB and California Guidelines The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), the Federal Regulatory agency governing the domestic wine industry and the import market in the United States, has strict visual guidelines for labels, including mandating size requirements for the typeface used on the front label. For example, the required appellation designation must be printed at least in 1 mm high text in a conspicuous location on the label for a container of 187 ml or less. California has even stricter requirements for label information. If the appellation listed reads \u201cCalifornia\u201d or a specific region of California, 100% of the grapes have to be from California. Let's examine a Napa Valley wine label in detail. Logo It's the first thing that catches your eye on a label, naturally. It can be a graphic or artwork, but it imparts an expression of identity: what the brand wants to tell you or what's in the bottle, which will ultimately drive your decision to purchase. Brand Name The brand name is the wine producer, winery, or vineyard. Increasingly \u201cbrand wine\u201d or fanciful names are becoming common. Proprietary Name or Fanciful Name The proprietary or fanciful name is a marketing tool named and owned by the brand to develop a following for a particular wine. It is not a mandatory part of the label. Remember the names Blue Nun, Emerald Dry, or Mateus? In the U.S. there is also \u201cMeritage,\u201d a licensed name used by Meritage Alliance members to promote their proprietary blends. Vintage The vintage is the harvest year of the grapes, not the bottling year. In the Napa Valley AVA or its sub-appellations, 95% of the grapes have to be of the vintage year listed. Wine Class or Varietal Name The label can state an official TTB wine class designation like \u201cRed Wine,\u201d \u201cWhite Wine,\u201d or \u201cSparkling Wine.\u201d It can also use \u201cTable Wine\u201d for a still grape wine or the predominant grape variety name like cabernet sauvignon. As a rule, wine labeled using a grape variety must be at least 75% by volume in the bottle of the specified grape and the varietal listed on a label must also be an approved grape name by the TTB. There also needs to be an appellation of origin appearing along with it, as all of the grapes of that grape varietal listed had to have been grown in that specific appellation. In the U.S., these \u201cTable Wines\u201d can't be more than 14% alcohol by volume (ABV), a classification used solely for determining the tax class by TTB. Appellation This is the viticulture area where the grapes are grown. Some labels go as far as to name a specific vineyard. If using the Napa Valley AVA or one of its sub-appellations, 100% of the grapes must be from the Napa Valley AVA. Vineyard Listing the vineyard is an optional designation that many wineries use to impart a standard of high-quality grapes. If the name of the vineyard is used on the label, 95% of the grapes have to be from that specific vineyard. Estate Bottled This is optional on wine bottle labels. If the term \u201cEstate Bottled\u201d is used, it means that 100% of the grapes were grown in vineyards that the estate owns or manages. The vineyard and the winery must be located within the AVA on the bottle. The grapes must be harvested, crushed, fermented, aged, and bottled at the winery, never leaving the property in the process. Special Designation The term \u201cReserve\u201d may be considered by wine drinkers as a special designation denoting a high-end wine, but the truth is, it has no legal meaning in the U.S. It can convey a special bottling by the winemaker, but it is only a marketing tool to appeal to the consumer. Alcohol Content This is required by law on the label which divides tax classes on alcohol by the TTB. All wines must be at less than 14% alcohol by volume. However, a wine labeled \u201cTable Wine\u201d does not need the alcohol content on the label as it is specifically classified by the table wine designation to be 14% or less. Alcohol can be shown on the front or back label. Courtesy of Raymond Vineyards Back Label Information Contains Sulfites All wines with sulfites 10 parts per million or higher of sulfur dioxide are required by law to say \u201cContains Sulfites.\u201d It's usually found on the label on the back of the bottle. Government Health Warnings The warnings are there by law and are thus mandatory on all alcohol sold in the U.S., generally on the back label. \u2013 101 Basic Wine Facts For The Budding Sommelier \u2013 \u2013 Napa Valley's Historic Wineries In Two Days \u2013 Author Michelle M.

        "title": "The Village at Vista Collina \u2014 Napa Valley's Newest Hotspot",
        "text": "The first thing I think when I see The Village at Vista Collina is how beautiful it is. Located at Vista Collina Resort , the newest lifestyle resort in Napa Valley (and just across the way from acclaimed sister property The Meritage Resort ), The Village is a palatial courtyard with a massive, manicured lawn, rows upon rows of giant shade umbrellas, and newly-built shops arrayed in an arc around it all. There's a food and wine center, an upscale grocery, tasting rooms, lawn games, and, weather permitting, evenings of live music. Courtesy of Vista Collina Resort The thoughtful curation of The Village begins at Fivetown Grocery , the upscale market smack-dab in the center of activity. It sells house-made pasta and sauces, smoked barbecue, freshly baked bread, as well as locally-made craft brews and wine. Chef Vincent Lesage, who leads Vista Collina Resort's culinary program, creates beautiful picnic baskets for diners to enjoy on the lawn. It's easy to dismiss picnic fare as cold food and lukewarm drinks, but this was the good stuff: charcuterie and cheese, sandwiches, fresh fruit, hummus, olives, house-made focaccia, individual serving-sized bottles of bubbly, and, the undisputed star of the show \u2013 a generous slice of glorious, decadent carrot cake to top it all off. Courtesy of Vista Collina Resort I called ahead for a reservation and asked for the Lawn Butler Service to nab one of the low-slung picnic tables under some shade. But if you're having a spontaneous day and find yourself at The Village without a reservation, it's not a problem. Fivetown Grocery can set you up with a picnic basket within 20-30 minutes. Or just pick up some items from the grocery \u00e0 la carte to snack on while playing a game of cornhole or ladder toss, as many groups do \u2013 especially those visiting with children or dogs, and those who prefer other social activities to drinking. But if you're in Napa, chances are drinking is exactly what you're here for, and to that, The Village does not disappoint. With nine tasting rooms , expect to sample an impressive number of wines, most of which are from smaller wineries and therefore not easily available. Courtesy of Vista Collina Resort At the newly-minted Jayson by Pahlmeyer tasting room, I was greeted first by a lifesize cardboard cutout of Jayson Pahlmeyer himself, and second by a loud, extroverted, sales associate in a Hawaiian shirt. His sleeves were rolled up, and he wasted no time with small-talk: his name was Skip, and Skip, it soon transpired, was a treasure trove of wine knowledge, with a long history working in Napa Valley before it became a destination. I sipped my wines as he talked, enjoying the depth of the chardonnay and the flavors of the pinot noir that I could drink by the bucketful. Hands down, the best part about tasting at Pahlmeyer was Skip's stories about wine, the community, and the history of the craft. It was like gathering around the dinner table to listen to your offbeat, fun uncle talk about his life's shenanigans. But instead of your uncle, swap in this rock-and-roll kind of guy dressed for vacation, waxing poetic about pinot noir and biodynamic agriculture and the time he poured for and drank wine with Julia Child. Courtesy of Vista Collina Resort This sense of storytelling and community legacy didn't end at Jayson by Pahlmeyer. Over at Luna Vineyards , Idalia was the wine associate pouring their estate-grown wines for three or four different parties. Ever the consummate hostess, she stopped by regularly to pour our wine and regale us with stories: how much she loved wine; how she began as a\u201dcrystal engineer\u201d (her lighthearted euphemism for one who polishes wine glasses); how she took a break from wine so she could learn about coffee; how one year, she tried to fry tamales in a torrential downpour and the ensuing chaos it created. Yes, the wine was good, but the stories were better. As someone who did not grow up in Napa Valley, this is what I imagine this place was like before Napa became a\u201ddestination.\u201d I'm likely romanticizing it, but at The Village, the sense of a Napa community doesn't feel like something from a bygone era, nor does it feel like something that's exclusive to wealthy winemakers. Rather, it feels authentic and immediate, something you can experience if you sit down with someone and ask them about more than just the vintage in the glass. By all means, do ask about the vintage in the glass, if that's what you're here for. But it's the history of a place and the craft that makes the wine taste richer, so don't forget to ask about that too. Courtesy of Vista Collina Resort The Village at Vista Collina 850 Bordeaux Way, Napa, CA 94558 The Village Food & Wine Center No need to be an aspiring restaurant chef to learn something here. The cooking and baking classes are designed by Chef Vincent Lesage. There's also an ongoing calendar of guest chefs and bakers, so learning new skills or honing existing ones has never been so delectable. Fivetown Grocery With farm-fresh, local ingredients and products, this upscale grocery store and market offers a taste of the five towns that make up Napa Valley. You'll find everything you need to create the perfect Napa picnic on the expansive community lawn, just outside, and can even reserve their butler service to curate the experience for you. Trinitas Cellars This small-production winery in Napa Valley focuses on enriching people's lives with memorable experiences. Signature varietals: chardonnay, cabernet franc Foley Food & Wine Society Here, you can schedule a private tasting, seminar, or other educational experience. Try something you like but don't want to risk putting a bottle in your luggage? They'll ship your purchase directly to your home. Signature varietals: cabernet sauvignon Luna Vineyards This pioneering winery began when this estate was the first to plant pinot grigio along the Silverado Trail. No surprise that the pinot grigio is still a crowd favorite, even among their selection of fantastic Italian wines. Signature varietals: pinot grigio, sangiovese GEN 7 Wines The first iteration of this winery was established in 1832 \u2013 the oldest winery in California. GEN 7 is the family's second generation modern remake, incorporating the history of this winery's craft. Signature varietals: cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir The Wine Foundry This winery raises a glass to the innovators, disruptors, and philosophers. The wine blends inspire the creative in us all, with names like Rose Against The Machine, The Anarchist, and The Philosopher. Signature varietals: ros\u00e9, blanc de blanc/blanc de noir, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon Napa Smith Brewery Change up your experience at The Village with some locally brewed craft beers. Likewise influenced by the culture and quality of the greatest wineries in the world, Napa Smith beers balance the best ingredients to make awesome beer. Signature brews: IPA, Lager, Pilsner Cornerstone Cellars On a mission to deliver Napa Valley's finest mountain and benchland cabernet sauvignon vineyards, Cornerstone Cellars wines boast a firm structure and nuanced texture. Signature varietals: cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc Jayson by Pahlmeyer With wines created by three of Napa Valley's most storied winemakers, Helen Turley, Bob Levy, and Randy Dunn, you can't go wrong having a glass (or three) here. Signature varietals: cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir, chardonnay Mi Sue\u00f1o Winery This boutique, Mexican-American, family-owned and operated winery produces fine wines from eight estate vineyards throughout the Napa Valley.

Once you and your pet have explored surrounding Yountville, rest assured that you're going home to ultimate luxury \u2014 all guest rooms at Bardessono are spa suites, designed to transform any room into your personal spa. You can relax with an in-room treatment or uninterrupted soak in the tub while your pooch reclines in similar luxury on the plush dog bed. 6526 Yount Street, Yountville, CA 94599, (707) 204-6000 R&R in Style Calistoga Motor Lodge & Spa Courtesy of Aubrie Pick/Calistoga Motor Lodge & Spa For a stay with a little more character, look no further that the Calistoga Motor Lodge & Spa. Fun, bright, and hip, there's plenty of space for you and your dog to explore. Their spa, MoonAcre Spa & Bath, is right there on grounds as well, so you can get a mud treatment, facial, or aromatherapy soak without being too far away. And with the treats that come in their doggie welcome package, your pup may not even notice that you're gone. 1880 Lincoln Avenue, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-0991 Carneros Resort & Spa Courtesy of Facebook: Carneros Resort & Spa Carneros Resort & Spa is a hotel that has both charm and luxurious amenities in spades. From high-end dining to stellar spa treatments to a beautiful pool, you won't run out of things to do here.

And with heat lamps and tables and chairs, you'll be able to enjoy a glass (or a bottle) in your own private slice of Napa Valley. 4048 Sonoma Highway, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 299-4900 SENZA Courtesy of SENZA SENZA is the perfect blend of upscale chic with bed-and-breakfast community.

The staff at this charming bed and breakfast go out of their way to welcome your pooch, with a special bag of doggie treats on check-in, and even setting aside a special part of the dining area so your dog can dine with you. We recommend booking in the Carriage House for its immediate access to the garden so your canine can be as comfortable as possible. 1910 1st Street, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 257-1649 Lavender \u2014 A Four Sisters Inn Courtesy of Lavender Lavender welcomes with a touch of the French countryside, and an easy walk to all of Yountville's offerings. Whether you and your pup cozy up to the in-room fireplace, bask lazily in the garden sunshine, or lounge on the inn's wraparound porch, Lavender is the perfect amount of cozy chic. Only one of the rooms is dog-friendly though, and it's in high demand, so be sure to plan ahead for your trip to Wine Country with your four-legged bestie. 2020 Webber Avenue, Yountville, CA 94599, (707) 944-1388 Courtesy of Archer Hotel Napa Don't forget that while we love our pooches, not everyone is a dog person, and many places have rules for keeping your pup on a leash. But that's no reason not to do it in style. We like these Found My Animal leashes, which are beautifully hand-dyed in New York and strong enough to withstand hundreds of pounds of pull. And with an option to secure the leash around your waist, you'll be able to walk the dog and keep your wine glass full.

        "title": "Plan A Napa Valley Day Trip to Lake Berryessa",
        "text": "It's hard to go half-a-mile in Napa Valley without passing a vineyard or winery \u2014 not that we're complaining \u2014 but there is one beautiful and uncharted destination that's worth a day trip during your California Wine Country vacation. Lake Berryessa is 26 miles long, but just 3 miles wide, with a myriad of quiet coves and 165 miles of shoreline to explore by car, bike, boat, or foot. In the summer, the water temps reach up to 75 degrees, making it the ideal destination for camping and boating with friends. It even has a glory hole; a spillway at the Monticello Dam. A decade-long dry spell ended in 2017 following heavy rains and turned this little-known glory hole into a tourist destination for a few wet weeks. Getting There Courtesy of Facebook: Lake Berryessa News Lake Berryessa is roughly a 45-minute drive from Napa along the rural, switchback CA 121-North. If you're visiting Napa Valley and are staying Upvalley, you can also reach Lake Berryessa from Rutherford along CA-128 E. Any vehicle will do, but a scenic drive like this, with few cars and a warm California day, is best done with the wind in your hair, \u00e0 la motorcycle or convertible. Insider Tip : Type your final destination into your maps app ahead of time, for you'll likely lose cell service along the way. Play Courtesy of Facebook: Lake Berryessa Boat and Jet Ski Rentals Choose from three marinas \u2014 Pleasure Cove , Markley Cove , and Lake Berryessa Boat & Jet Ski Rentals \u2014 from which they can rent a plethora of water crafts, like kayaks, jet skis, fishing boats (there's a variety of fish to catch, including catfish, brown and rainbow trout, largemouth bass, and kokanee salmon), pontoons, and party barges equipped with slides. You can even spend a whole week on a houseboat. Oak Shores Park is the most popular day use area among visitors; it's a free place to hang, sunbathe, and swim, plus it has a boat launch. There are also plenty of year-round hiking opportunities at the lake too, like Smittle Creek, an easy, 2.6-mile jaunt that leads to Oak Shores Park. The four-mile, strenuous Stebbins Cold Canyon Trail loop will have you climbing a total of 1500 ft., resulting in stunning views of the lake from above. The North End Trail is a moderate and especially scenic hike along the north shore of the lake with the chance to spot bald eagles, pelicans, and osprey. If you put together several sections of this trail, you can hike over eight miles round trip. The windy roads of Lake Berryessa are also a favorite of cyclists; they are safest in the offseason, when the summer crowds have dispersed. Stay Courtesy of Facebook: Markley Cove Marina & Resort No fancy Napa Valley hotels or resorts here. If you're planning to stay the night, your going to have to pitch a tent. There are several options with lakeside campsites: check out Spanish Flat Resort , Putah Canyon , Steele Canyon Campground , and Pleasure Cove Campground and Marina , which is a convenient option if you're going to be renting a boat. There are two exceptions to camping at Lake Berryessa; sleep on the water by renting a houseboat or reserve a cozy cabin at Markley Cove . Sip Courtesy of Facebook: Somerston Estate There aren't too many wineries out by the lake, but there are a handful you can stop in at for a tasting along the drive. You'll pass Nichelini Family Winery for instance; at 128 years old, it's the oldest family owned and operated winery in Napa Valley. You can also make an appointment to visit Somerston Estate , which sits on more than 1,600 scenic acres at 1,600 ft. in elevation. If you drive around the lake, past the dam, and head towards the town of Winters, pull over for a pint or two from Berryessa Brewing Company . This place may seem like it's in the middle of nowhere, but it's positively hopping (pun intended) at Happy Hour and on weekends. The vibe here is super casual, family and dog-friendly, and has ample outdoor space. They also have food trucks and live music almost daily. Eat Courtesy of Facebook: Silverado Market & Bakery Lake Berryessa is truly a rural area. There aren't really any restaurants, so you'll want to go prepared. One option, plan on stopping in at the Silverado Market and Bakery on your way out from Napa. But, your best bet at stocking up on drinks and snacks around Lake Berryessa is Turtle Rock \u2014 and truly, no trip to the area is complete without it. Turtle Rock is a local dive bar and small general store, a favorite stop of motorcyclists where dollar bills cloak the ceiling. Here you must complete the Turtle Rock right of passage: downing a few of their world famous egg rolls, made with a secret ingredient (it's spam; don't knock it \u2018til you try it). It doesn't get more local than this place. The one Lake Berryessa restaurant is a hidden gem called Cucina Italiana , located at the Spanish Flat Village Center. It's a casual, family-owned, and authentic Italian restaurant right off the lake. They serve up giant plates of pasta, the perfect medicine after an active day on the water. Note: Bring cash, and they're closed Monday-Wednesday.

        "text": "There is something in the air during Harvest Season in Napa Valley. Maybe it's the buzz of the vineyard workers or the influx of visitors at local Napa Valley hotspots or the smell of grapes being turned into wine. Every year from August through October, winemakers and vineyard workers race against nature to pick grapes at the peak of ripeness and get them into the fermenter to begin the fruit's journey into a fantastic bottle of wine. Harvest is peak season for visiting Napa Valley, mainly because there is so much to do. Between special parties and celebrations, like hands-on grape stomping and winemaking and opportunities to see the fields in action, it's a season you don't want to miss. We've rounded up a collection of fun activities for curious oenophiles and enthusiastic wine sippers planning an adventure to Napa Valley's Wine Country this Harvest. Wine Tasting During Harvest Season Courtesy of Pine Ridge Vineyards Before you book your tasting, check out if the winery offers any tours of their property, vineyards, or wine making facilities. Many local, Napa Valley wineries want to give insight into their process and allow guests to go into the cellar, see winemakers and winery teams in action, and maybe even try some wine straight out of the barrel. Stags Leap Districts' Pine Ridge Vineyards hosts two fantastic, interactive tours that offers access to their impressive network of caves with a tour care of their knowledgeable wine educators. Depending on which elevated experience you choose, your behind-the-scenes look ends in either a seated cheese and wine tasting or an impressive multi-bite meal in their beautiful Cellar 47 tasting lounge located deep in the cave. Dining During Harvest Season Courtesy of The Charter Oak, photography by Kelly Puleio Napa Valley cuisine focuses on seasonal and local ingredients, and many restaurants are sourcing their wares from the region's farmers and artisans. Visit the awarded The Charter Oak for elemental, meat-centric menu care of famed chef, Christopher Kostow. Their dishes focus on one to two ingredients, and celebrates locally-inspired food in an airy space with a impressive central hearth. If you're looking to meet the newest culinary talent of Napa Valley's Wine Country, we recommend grabbing a table at the Culinary Institute at Greystone's Gatehouse Restaurant . As the capstone experience for aspiring chefs, guests can expect an innovative menu and creative cooking. There is lots of excitement during harvest, but there are also a lot of travelers. Be sure to make reservations at your favorite Napa Valley restaurants to ensure you have a seat saved at the table. Events During Harvest Season Many wineries have special harvest events going on during the season. We've compiled an extensive list of must-do events and winery experiences for this exciting time of year. No matter what you do during your visit to Napa Valley during harvest, there is something special about being a part of the action and learning more about the dedication Napa Valley Wine Country's vineyard owners and winemakers have to growing grapes and making the wine you love. \u2014 Tour Tamber Bey with the Vintner \u2014 \u2014 Pine Ridge Vineyards Offers One of Napa's Best Wine Cave Experiences \u2014 Author Jen Schmitz Jen Schmitz has been writing and producing creative content since 2014.

        "title": "Calistoga Hot Springs: Soak, Steam, Rest, Repeat",
        "text": "Most people know what a hot spring consists of (a natural source of hot or warm water), and that Calistoga is known for its mineral baths of all kinds. But how does it work, and why is this relaxation practice good for you? One thing we've learned is that because heated water holds more dissolved solids, hot springs have a high mineral content, which means it's all the better for a soak. And while there may not be a ton of scientific research into its health benefits, we do know that this practice of using heat to release toxins is tens of thousands of years old. With its geothermal hot springs of mineral water running underground, Calistoga has a renowned history as a place of healing. Over 50 years ago, members of the Wappo tribe were the first to discover a natural volcanic hot spring near the foot of Mount St. Helena. The rest is spa-history, with visitors coming from far and wide to take part in the curative powers of Calistoga, by relaxing in a mineral-rich hot spring or a volcanic mud bath. The health benefits may mostly be based on folklore and anecdotal evidence, but there's no denying the zen-like state one emerges with after a long, hot soak. If it makes you feel better and more relaxed, that's half the battle, isn't it? We've rounded up some of our favorite spa experiences that offer that famed Calistoga mineral water for your next trip to Wine Country. Get ready to soak, steam, rest, and repeat. Calistoga Spa Hot Springs Courtesy of Facebook: Calistoga Spa Hot Springs Because one healing geothermal mineral pool isn't enough, Calistoga Spa Hot Springs has four , and each is heated to a different temperature to suit all preferences. Have a soak in the outdoor whirlpool, which can get as hot as 104\u00b0 F (perfect for year-round dips), or enjoy the Soaking Pool and its 100\u00b0 F waters. If you're itching for some exercise as well as rejuvenation, the multi-lane lap pool is heated to a cool 80\u00b0 F, and the wading pool is perfect for wee spa guests. Insider Tip \u2014 If you have a friend who just wants to join in on their geothermal mineral pools, they can accompany you as your guest for a $25 fee. 1006 Washington Street, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-6269 UpValley Inn & Hot Springs Courtesy of UpValley Inn & Hot Springs Commitment is the word we'd like to use for UpValley Inn & Hot Springs, as they are one of the few properties which have their swimming pool and whirlpool 100% fed by Calistoga mineral water drawn from their onsite geothermal well. Once you've soaked to your heart's content, indulge the body a little more with their brand-new, handcrafted dry sauna and steam room. And with the crisp, refreshing decor and tranquil guest rooms on site, you'll never have to rouse yourself from your sense of zen. Feel like exploring beautiful Calistoga, but haven't made plans past your spa experience? Fear not, you'll be able to with the town's complimentary shuttle service, providing on-demand transportation to dining, wine-tasting, shopping, and other Wine Country activities, creating the perfect balance of relaxation and adventure. 1865 Lincoln Avenue, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-9400 Mount View Hotel & Spa Courtesy of Facebook: Mount View Hotel & Spa To make relaxation an art, start your getaway at Mount View Hotel & Spa. Take a dip in the mineral waters of the hot tub and then recline in style in a cabana by the heated pool. There are also a myriad of bath-related treatments to choose from at the spa, from oxygen baths to mineral mudbaths. And for those who want a little more outside the box experience, the spa also offers Cannabidiol (CBD) oil massages. We're willing to bet you don't see that on the menu at your local day spa. Mount View Hotel & Spa has also adopted a \u201ccause integration\u201d to hospitality and donates 50% of its profits to charity, to causes such as St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Ole Health, Project Ceres, and more. So if you're civic-minded, you can relax easy knowing that while you're laying your head at night, your stay is changing the world for the better. 1457 Lincoln Avenue, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-1500 Calistoga Ranch Courtesy of Calistoga Ranch This indulgent resort experience is tucked away in an Upvalley canyon on a 157 acre spread of land. If that seclusion alone isn't enough to find your inner zen, enjoy your dip in the mineral waters of Calistoga while nestled away in the woods, or soothe soaking with a view of a creek and moss-laden oaks, or sample rejuvenating spa treatments in restful, private rooms. Auberge Spa pays homage to the centuries-old legacy of Calistoga healing waters with natural geothermal baths and treatment rooms integrated into this serene sanctum of a resort. Bring nature to the forefront of your relaxing vacation, with the elegant appointments of Calistoga Ranch blurring the lines between indoor and outdoor, creating a unique intimacy with the beautiful environment. 580 Lommel Road, Calistoga, CA 94515, (855) 942-4220 Solage Courtesy of Solage Another Auberge Resort that takes the experience of mineral springs of Calistoga up a notch, Solage is the sophisticated-chic sister to the more secluded Calistoga Ranch. Artfully designed and ecologically conscious, Napa Valley Spa Solage includes updated twists to the renowned Calistoga mud and mineral water therapies. If you're in town celebrating a romantic weekend, check out the Starlight at the Bathhouse experience, where you can soak, steam, and retreat in private under the stars. Sparkling wine and a shared dessert too? Don't mind if we do. When you're ready for some social interaction, take advantage of Solage's social events, with pool parties, sound meditation workshops, film festivals, and of course, learning to be a winemaker for a day. 755 Silverado Trail, Calistoga, CA 94515, (866) 942-7442 Calistoga Motor Lodge & Spa Courtesy of Calistoga Motor Lodge & Spa The Calistoga Motor Lodge & Spa is newly reinvented and captures the adventurous spirit of a classic American road trip. If you're in it for the sleek 1950s period vibe, we won't blame you. The MoonAcre spa on site is similarly whimsical and relaxing, with cheeky signage and enviable digs no matter if you're enjoying the outdoor swimming pool, wading pool, indoor whirlpool (all fed by the property's own mineral spring, naturally), or the classic bathhouse. (We even sent one of our writers there to get down and dirty in the mineral mudbath and see what all the indulgent fuss was about. Spoiler: it was me, and it was awesome.) 1880 Lincoln Ave, Calistoga, CA 94515,(707) 942-0992 Golden Haven Hot Springs Courtesy of Facebook: Golden Have Hot Springs and Spa Golden Haven has private, mineral mudbath rooms to accommodate duos, as well as individuals who want a little silent soak time. For a more communal, less muddy experience, check out their hot springs pool, which is heated by the hot springs mineral water and emerges from the ground at between 140-150\u00b0 Fahrenheit. With 28 rooms, Golden Haven also has space for an overnight stay, so you can remain in that totally zen state of mind. For the truly exclusive experience, book one of their hot springs rooms, which feature a private, two-person whirlpool spa. Best of all, the water that feeds this hot tub comes from the same underground hot springs source used throughout the resort. Doesn't get more private than that. 1713 Lake Street, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-8000 \u2014 Tour Tamber Bey with the Vintner \u2014 \u2014 10 Best Ways to Celebrate Napa Valley's 2018 Harvest Season \u2014 Author Julia Chang Julia Chang is a writer based out of San Francisco, California.

        "title": "Pine Ridge Vineyards Offers One of Napa's Best Wine Cave Experiences",
        "text": "With 500 options in Napa Valley, many wineries find creative ways to stand out and lure in visitors. Some will invite you into their wine caves, for instance, while others might offer a cheese pairing, or even a multi-course wine and food experience. Pine Ridge Vineyards does all three. Tucked away from the Silverado Trail in Napa Valley's famous Stags Leap District \u2014 most known for putting Napa Valley wine on the world map in the 1976 Judgment of Paris \u2014 Pine Ridge Vineyards welcomes guests on two of the most informative and memorable wine tasting experiences in all of Northern California's Wine Country. I've been fortunate enough to experience both of their elevated offerings: the Wine Tasting and Cave Tour (complete with a cheese pairing) and Savor Pine Ridge, which pairs five wines with gourmet bites. Both are fantastic and priced at a great value, so read on to decide which one is right for you. The Tours Courtesy of Jen Schmitz and Jess Lander These Pine Ridge experiences begin with a welcome splash of wine and a tour of the estate vineyard, cellar, and caves. The Wine Tasting and Cave Tour is the most extensive, roughly 90 minutes and includes a barrel sample. The Savor tour is an abridged version, as there's a greater focus on the food and wine pairing to come. Starting in front of the estate vineyard, we learned about the soils, how Pine Ridge Vineyards has vines planted on some of the steepest slopes in the valley, the grape growing process, and the history of the winery dating back to 1978. We weren't empty handed either, soaking in this knowledge while sipping a delightful chardonnay; it was a perfect balance between light and crisp and elegant and rich. One main theme that stood out to me throughout both tours was technology. Winemaker Michael Beaulac clearly cares about not just maintaining the wine quality but also improving it. He and his team are on top of the latest and greatest advancements in the industry and are even running their own experiments to benefit the region as a whole. In the vineyard, for example, vineyard manager Gustavo Avina , who has been with Pine Ridge Vineyards since 2003, has installed innovative, vineyard climate stations. These enable him to remotely control things like irrigation right from his smartphone. In the cellar, Pine Ridge Vineyards has imported some very expensive concrete fermenters from Italy, which kind of look like Apollo spacecrafts. Beaulac mentioned he's still experimenting with them, but that they should add an extra freshness to the wine. I could go on and on, but I don't want to give it all away. Courtesy of Jen Schmitz The tours finish 130 feet underground in the 32,000-sq. ft. cave, home to 3,000 barrels and composed of just over three-quarters of a mile of tunnels (that's pretty big for a wine cave). I've personally lost count of the wine caves I've seen all over the world, everything from damp, hand-dug caves built centuries ago to perfectly manicured ones covered in marble. Because of this, I'm not easily moved by what a winery has underground, but Pine Ridge Vineyards' cool cave truly stuck out for the experience offered within it. This isn't the standard cave walk through; we actually got to stay awhile, sit down, and taste the wines. The sound of working forklifts in the background wasn't so much distracting, as a cool and authentic addition to the experience. The Good Stuff Courtesy of Jen Schmitz Pine Ridge Vineyards is the definition of a Napa Cab House. Yes, they produce some other wines, like chardonnay and ros\u00e9, but cabernet is undeniably their signature grape. The winemaking team produces single-appellation cabs from the best producing regions (AVAs) around Napa Valley: Stags Leap, Rutherford, Oakville, and Howell Mountain. All of the wines provide a unique opportunity to sip your way through Napa Valley, identify the differences in the varying terroirs, and then determine which AVA you fancy the most. My favorite AVA has consistently been Rutherford, known for its unique \u201cRutherford Dust\u201d soil, which was reaffirmed during my Pine Ridge Vineyards visit. The wine and cheese pairing occurs at an intimate round table in the cave, set in front of a gorgeous Chihuly glass sculpture. At my seat, there were three wine glasses and a plate with a trio of cheeses, dried fruits, and house-made, savory biscotti. For this tasting, we tried the Rutherford, Oakville, and Stags Leap cabs, each matched with a cheese. When I've done cheese pairings before, more often than not, it's with local cheeses. I'm all for supporting the local farmers, but I also really appreciate that Pine Ridge Vineyards prioritizes quality and choosing the perfect match to showcase their wines. They've carefully selected dynamite cheeses (two hard, one soft) from France, Spain, and Holland, and they were so delicious that I actually wrote down their names so I could attempt to seek them out later. Courtesy of Jess Lander The cheese pairing is truly delightful, but if you want the ultimate, VIP experience, book Savor. It takes place in a chic and cozy cave lounge called Cellar 47 \u2014 the kind of place you'd hope to hide out in during an apocalypse; think, chic, colorful furniture and rugs, with multiple nooks for lounging and sipping \u2014 and we got to sip the full gamut of wines. One-by-one, we tasted through five cabernets: the four single-appellation cabs, plus FORTIS, the winery's flagship cabernet made with the best grapes from the best blocks (it's big and bold like its name suggests). Priced at $225 a bottle, it's a real treat to taste this. Each wine was paired with a substantial, gourmet bite prepared by winery chef Susan Lassalette. The menu stays consistent, only changing up when a new vintage is released. Courtesy of Facebook: Pine Ridge Vineyards Despite what you might expect for cabernet pairings, just one of the pairings was beef. Lassalette gets creative with unconventional pairings, proving that wine and food pairing rules are made to be broken. My favorite bite was the savory, Parmesan panna cotta, though I ultimately felt that the best pairing of the day was the Niman Ranch beef empanada with a spicy pimento dolce. As for the rest of the bites, I'll let you find out for yourself. Just when we thought we were finished with Savor, we were given a bonus surprise: a pair of custom made chocolates for dessert. The Wine Tasting and Cave Tour ($75) is offered daily at 10 AM and 2 PM. Savor Pine Ridge ($125 per person) is offered daily at 11 AM and 1 PM. Both experiences last roughly 90 minutes.

        "text": "If you want a crash course in what the Wine Country lifestyle is all about, look no further than Napa Valley \u2018s new, luxury resort Vista Collina , which will be celebrating its grand opening on July 15, 2018. The resort is located a convenient, five minute drive from downtown Napa, but truth be told, you won't have much reason to leave \u2013 and you might not want to either. Courtesy of Vista Collina Set on 11 luscious acres, the Tuscan-style resort has its own mini version of Downtown Napa called The Village. There you can sip wine at eight boutique wine tasting rooms, like Cornerstone Cellars (no reservations required), grab a pint at Napa Smith Brewery \u2018s new taproom, shop at Fivetown Grocery , an artisanal market where you can curate your own picnic, and take hands-on cooking classes at the Food & Wine Center . There's even a giant, picnic-perfect lawn that doubles as a concert and events venue. If you're lucky, you can catch a show during your stay. Courtesy of Vista Collina Relax in a cabana by the resort's luxe swimming pool and jacuzzi, and if you feel the need to counter all the Wine Country fun, there's a fitness center offering group classes. Moreover, take a short stroll across the street to Vista Collina's neighbor, the Meritage Resort , where many of their amenities are open to the public, including Spa Terra, uniquely located in a 22,000-square-foot Estate Cave, a bowling alley, sports lounge, and restaurant. Courtesy of Vista Collina Vista Collina boasts 145 tranquil rooms, 39 of which are one bedroom suites with spacious living rooms, dining areas, deep soaking tubs, and high-tech kitchens. Guests receive a welcome bottle of wine upon arrival, which in the Vineyard View rooms, is best enjoyed from the balcony overlooking the resort's nine acres of estate vines. Courtesy of Vista Collina Want to stay in, make your own Wine Country meal, and pretend that your Napa vacation is your daily reality? Have fresh, seasonal ingredients delivered right to your suite, and then cook them up with the assistance of the Hestan Cue Smart Cooking System . Vista Collina's Executive Chef Vincent Lesage will take you step-by-step through the recipe \u2014 perhaps a pan seared salmon with grenobloise sauce \u2014 via an instructional video. As you follow along, the smart cooking system will react and adjust to ensure you don't miss a beat and cook the dish to perfection. Good luck going back to your home kitchen after that. Courtesy of Vista Collina But surely, you'll eventually want to leave your Wine Country paradise to explore Napa Valley; it's the whole reason you made the trip, right? If you do manage to tear yourself away from your glorious Vista Collina bubble, the resort offers complimentary shuttles to Downtown Napa. Peruse boutique and luxury shops, stop in at the many wine tasting rooms, and dine at world class restaurants. From there, you can walk over the First Street bridge to the Oxbow District, where you can experience the bustling Oxbow Public Market , take wine and cooking classes at the CIA Copia , and pop into more wine tasting rooms. In celebration of their Grand Opening, Vista Collina is offering a limited-time offer of 25% off your stay, plus a $50 resort credit. \u2014 San Francisco to Napa: A Tasting Guide \u2014 \u2014 Meet the Chefs Behind Some of Napa Valley's Best Restaurants \u2014 Author Jess Lander Jess Lander is a freelance wine, food and travel writer based in Napa Valley and exploring all things California wine country.

        "title": "Wine Taste Like a Pro",
        "text": "Wine is not just grapes; it's a storyteller that shares tales about the region, the people, and the culture behind it. While it's easy to drink wine, learning to taste wine brings about a greater appreciation for all the other elements that go into the glass. Whether you're a beginner who's first getting into wine or an aficionado, learning how to properly taste can help you distinguish a good wine from a great wine and enhance your overall drinking experience. GETTING STARTED Mindset The first thing to remember is that tasting is about learning. There's never a right or wrong answer to the aromas you detect or the different flavors you taste. Wine professionals are always tasting because they too need to educate themselves. With thousands of grapes growing in hundred of regions around the world, there's no possible way anyone can know it all; never be intimidated. Glassware There is a dizzying array of glass options available, all meant to enhance certain characteristics in different wines. However, one good quality all-purpose glass is really all you need for wine tasting, especially if you're a beginner. One wine professional I know swears by his $60 Zalto glass, but personally, my favorite tasting glass was a souvenir from a wine event. Try to avoid plastic when possible; while they're great for the pool, they can affect the way the wine smells and tastes. Temperature In America, we have a tendency to serve whites a bit too cold, which masks the nuances, and reds a bit too warm, which enhances the alcohol. Ideal temps are around 40-50 degrees for sparkling wines and light, dry white wines; 50-60 degrees for fuller bodies white wines and light red wines; and 60-65 degrees for full-bodied red wines. Environment Any time wine is front of you, it's a great time to taste. That being said, if you really want to focus, a well-lit room with minimal distractions, such as music, is the ideal tasting environment. Perfume and cologne can interfere as well, so it's best to forgo scent altogether. HOW TO TASTE Color Hold the glass up to a white background and tilt it away from you. You'll want to notice the the range of hues, which could be an early indicator of grape varieties. For whites, this could go from very pale yellow-green to deep gold, while reds can display ruby, garnet, or even amber. The color on the rim of the wine can also tell a story: older whites will have a bit more of a burnished gold, while older reds may have a tinge of brown. Aroma Swirl the wine around a few times to give it some air and allow the aromas to open up. Stick your nose in the glass \u2013 don't be afraid to really get in there \u2013 and take some deep whiffs. Move your nose around the glass in quadrants; you can pick up different aromas this way. When I first started tasting wine, I created different categories of aromas, and thought about each one individually, as if running down a list: Fruit Spices/Herbs Earth/Savory (such as meat and tobacco) Flowers Nuts From there you can start getting specific: What kind of fruit are you getting? Red berries? Pears? Is it a black pepper kind of spice or a sweet baking spice? As you start to identify scents, you can create new categories for yourself, such as vegetal notes. It's a wine tasting technique I still use today as I find this methodic way of tasting helps me sort through and pinpoint different aromas. The different scents can give you clues to how a wine is made and its age. Creamy, buttery, and popcorn notes, commonly found in white wines, indicates a wine has gone through malolactic fermentation, a process where malic acids are softened and converted into lactic acids. Coconut, vanilla, or oak notes present the possibility of barrel aging. Young wines will often have an exuberant fruit character, but older wines will develop what's known as tertiary aromas; for white wines, that can be nutty tones while red wines may showcase leather, tobacco, and meaty notes. Taste With your first sip, hold the wine in your mouth, swirl it around, and suck in a little bit of air. Note how it feels on your palate and on your tastebuds. When assessing wine, there are several things to think about: Dry vs Sweet \u2013 Often, fruity wines are misconstrued as being \u201csweet\u201d wines, when in fact they're dry. Sweet wines, such as dessert wines, will have some perceptible sugar on the tongue. Acid \u2013 That mouthwatering effect is due to the acid in wine. The higher the level, the more you'll salivate. Wines described as \u201czippy\u201d and \u201cfresh\u201d are often high in acidity. Body \u2013 A common analogy to describe body is skim milk to whole milk. The weightier the wine, the more body it's considered to possess. Tannins \u2013 The dry, astringent feeling red wines give you is often due to the tannins, which are chemical compounds found in grapes, but can come from oak barrels as well. Tannins give wine structure and as wine ages, tannins soften and become more integrated. Length \u2013 When a wine lingers in mouth long after you've swallowed, it's considered to have a long length and is often an indicator of a well-made wine. Simple vs Complex \u2013 One-note, simple wines do have their place (think poolside sippers), but complex wines keep evolving and revealing nuances. This is the kind of wine that you keep going back for, whereas simple wines might be a one-and-you're-done scenario. Flavors \u2013 The aroma categories also apply here; by going through your list, you can identify different flavors that appear on your palate. Summing It Up The most important question to ask when tasting wine is, do you like it? There's no point in drinking something that doesn't suit you. But as a beginner, it's also important to think of this wine as a starting point; the characteristics you like can be connectors to other types of wines. Be curious and keep tasting; you'll never know where the wine journey will take you. \u2014 San Francisco to Napa: A Tasting Guide \u2014 \u2014 The Perfect Napa Valley Itinerary for First-Time Visitors \u2014 Author Shana Clarke Shana Clarke is a freelance journalist and consultant based in New York City.

        "title": "San Francisco to Napa: A Tasting Guide",
        "text": "Let's face it \u2013 between the vineyards, wineries, world-class restaurants, and beautiful hotels, planning a trip to Napa means you're looking through a myriad of options, even if you're coming on a day trip from San Francisco. But lest all the choices lead you to decision fatigue, we've compiled some of our favorite places to eat, drink, and stay (and even an all-in-one option, for those who might be pressed for time). Where To Eat Courtesy of La Toque The Grove at CIA Copia Presented by The Culinary Institute of America (the other CIA), the CIA at Copia is a place for visitors (and food and wine lovers) to gather and participate in a variety of programs and experiences, from hands-on cooking and baking classes, to wine-tasting classes (naturally), and panel discussions about sustainability in food practices. Then when you're done learning, have a bite to eat. The Grove at CIA Copia is where all of that talk gets put into practice, inside the massive, open kitchen. The menu is seasonal and ever changing, but features such tasty gems as the Spicy Mussels and the Truffle Crespelle (an Italian-style crepe full of the delectable fungi). 500 First Street, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 967-2555 Morimoto Napa Itching to balance out all that wine tasting with some different spirits? At Morimoto's, you can enjoy sake in Wine Country. Momosan's Sake Bar, located inside the restaurant, is the only sake and Japanese whiskey bar in Napa Valley. Contemporary while still paying tribute to tradition, the menu is a happy balance of top-notch sushi options, as well as more non-traditional Japanese fare. Dining omakase (chef's choice) when at a sushi restaurant, especially at one with such a reputable chef, is always fantastic. For the a la carte eaters, you'll have to make the tough choice yourself of which beautiful dish to order, since, at Morimoto Napa, you eat with your eyes first. The Toro Tartare comes out unlike any tartare we've ever seen, with the ingredients plated as if on an artist's palette, for you to dip, combine, and mix into a bite of your choosing. Pipettes of colored sauces come ready for the dripping on sashimi cubes, and the menu features such cultural blends as bone marrow with teriyaki sauce and five spice, sashimi caesar salad, and sea urchin carbonara. 610 Main Street, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 252-1600 In-N-Out While delectable for your palate, Wine Country isn't always the friendliest to your wallet. Sometimes, after some stellar vinos, you just want something low-key, familiar, and fabulous \u2013 without the price tag. Located in Imola, which just across from Highway 29 and a short drive from downtown Napa, In-n-Out is a staple burger joint for those who are familiar with California. We won't get into the battle of the burgers (because all the burgers deserve love), but if you're visiting from out of town, treat yourself to an inexpensive, delicious meal. Cheeseburger, fries (Animal Style, please!), some extra banana peppers, and a Neopolitan shake. Doesn't get much better than that. 820 W Imola Avenue, Napa, CA 94559, (800) 786-1000 La Toque Consistently excellent, Chef Ken Frank's La Toque has earned a Michelin Star every year they have been awarded in Wine Country. La Toque takes care to have something for everyone, with three different dinner menus offered nightly. There's the Core Menu and the luxe Chef's Table Tasting Menu, not to mention the Vegetable Tasting Menu \u2013 an entire menu dedicated to those who want a delectable dining experience featuring only vegetables, many of which are from Napa Valley. Go green, anyone? 1314 McKinstry Street, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 257-5157 Where To Drink Courtesy of Cuvaison Cuvaison Nestled into the rolling hills of Carneros, Cuvaison is a beautiful, sustainable estate known for its distinctive chardonnays and pinot noirs. Dedicated to producing vineyard-driven wines, Cuvaison treats each \u2018block' as its own little vineyard, harvested separately and made into its own batch of wine. The architecture is modern and without being intrusively so; you might feel like you're the only person sitting on this wrap-around patio, sipping your wine flight and listening to the sounds of geese frolicking at the lake in the distance. Enjoy the panoramic view of the rolling hills, and know that the wine you're drinking and the views you're seeing are all part of an eco-friendly, certified Napa green estate and winery. 1221 Duhig Road, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 942-2455 Domaine Carneros Tingle your taste buds with some bubbly from Domaine Carneros. You'd be forgiven for thinking you've just transported yourself to Europe, once you set eyes on the magnificent French ch\u00e2teau atop the knoll, surrounded by vineyards as far as you can see. Domaine Carneros is the stateside counterpart to France's Champagne Taittinger and known for their sparkling wines ranging from the classic vintage-dated brut cuvee to blanc de blancs (sparkling wine made entirely from white grapes). 1240 Duhig Road, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 257-0101 Ashes & Diamonds For those looking for a fresh and vibrant tasting experience, Ashes & Diamonds' contemporary approach to mid-century modern is just the ticket. With the bright pops of primary-colored decor, desert landscaping, and an outdoor fire pit, you might forget that you are in the midst of lush Wine Country if it weren't for the Napa Valley wines \u2013 the ultimate blend of modern and old-school flavors, which \u201cadhere to an ethos of light-handed winemaking and transparency of terroir.\u201d Additionally, we swoon over the minimalist typographic bottle labels alone. 4130 Howard Lane, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 666-4777 Where To Stay Courtesy of Silverado Resort and Spa Silverado Resort and Spa At this sprawling hotel and resort, you can choose which distinct neighborhood to stay in, each featuring its own unique experience. The Mansion Estates and Cottage Drive will be more central, while The Grove and Oak Creek East provide more privacy and seclusion. Either way, enjoy the lush gardens, pristine pools and tennis courts, no matter which neighborhood you choose. With the regal colonial mansion amidst the California palm trees, Silverado Resort and Spa will transport you immediately to vacation. 1600 Atlas Peak Road, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 257-0200 Poetry Inn For the literary bed and breakfast experience, look no further than Poetry Inn in Napa Valley. This intimate inn boasts five beautiful suites that are charmingly named after revered writers, but do not sacrifice any modern conveniences. With spectacular views from each room, you'll be able to soak in the poetry of Wine Country in ultimate comfort. Book through WineCountry Perks and receive added amenities like a cheese board upon arrival, daily multi-course breakfast, and a tasting experience at Clif Lede Vineyards . 6380 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 944-0646 Where to Have it All Courtesy of Facebook: Carneros Resort and Spa Carneros Resort & Spa For the all-in-one experience, check out the offerings at Carneros Resort & Spa. Book the Courtyard Home for the whole family, or the Cottage with a view of the vineyard and a private outdoor patio. Or, if you're traveling with several in your party, the Harvest Suite is two individual cottages with an adjoining patio, deck, and firepit. It doesn't feel so much a hotel experience as it does a private estate stay. Treat yourself to a massage or manicure, or take a dip in the pool and soak in the sweeping views of this modern rustic estate. Getting hungry? No need to leave the premises. Save yourself an extra trip out with the car or limo by dining at the family of restaurants at Carneros. FARM at Carneros Everything at FARM at Carneros is a delight: the outdoor seating around fire pits, the gorgeous, vaulted ceilings, the hand-crafted cocktail program, dish after delectable dish from their dinner menu. The burrata is a mild, creamy beginning for your meal, punctuated with the sweet tang of grapefruit and garden onion. The truffle tagliatelle is a perfect proportion of umami and pasta, but is not to be outdone by the mushroom risotto. The smoked duck breast is always cooked perfectly and comes as a large portion, so be sure to make room for the dessert. Boon Fly Cafe If wait times are any indication, the Boon Fly Cafe is not to be missed. Lively and vibrant, the cafe serves modern rustic cuisine, and includes gluten-free as well as paleo options. The house-made donuts are a must have, but if you're looking for something other than brunch food, fear not \u2013 the fried chicken and malt waffles are another crowd favorite. 4048 Sonoma Highway, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 299-4900 Cover image courtesy of Facebook: Carneros Resort and Spa \u2014 72 Hours of Food in St. Helena \u2014 \u2014 Guide to a Weekend in Calistoga \u2014 Author Julia Chang Julia Chang is a writer based out of San Francisco, California.

        "text": "It's no great secret that in addition to award-winning wine, Wine Country is also home to fantastic food and dining options that are focused on local, fresh, beautiful produce. Whether you're spending the weekend exclusively in St. Helena , or making a stop or two on your Napa Valley journey, everyone has to eat. Luckily, St. Helena houses some stellar dining establishments, no matter what you may be craving. For weekend travelers who want to pack as much of St. Helena into 72 hours as they can, we've compiled a list of the best bites this charming town has to offer, from delectable desserts to unfussy burgers to complementary bites for your wine tasting. PRESS Courtesy of Facebook: PRESS Restaurant If you're hankering after some red meat, try PRESS, with its modern steakhouse cuisine with a distinctly Napa Valley flair. With the largest collection of Napa Valley wines in the world, PRESS can meet your needs for all of the valley's varietals as you get your daily intake of protein, whether its in a dry-aged New York strip steak, or wild-caught Gulf Coast jumbo prawns, or the PRESS charcuterie plate. 587 St Helena Hwy, St Helena, CA 94574, (707) 967-0550 The Charter Oak Courtesy of The Charter Oak, Photography by Kelly Puleio Elemental is the word to describe the hearth-centered cooking of The Charter Oak, helmed by chef Christopher Kostow, who is a James Beard Award 2018 semi-finalist for his Michelin-starred The Restaurant at Meadowood . His newest venture, also nominated for Best New Restaurant, focuses on showcasing \u201cfood, surfaces, [and] materials, in such a way that their essence is revealed.\u201d The dishes reflect products in an elegant and unforced manner, with an emphasis of produce from The Charter Oak's 2.5 acre culinary garden. Aesthetically, their dishes offer up a modern take in a traditionally rustic-centered area, pleasing both to the eye as well as the palate. 1050 Charter Oak Avenue, St. Helena, CA 94574, (707) 302-6996 Two Birds/One Stone Courtesy of Two Birds/One Stone At Two Birds/One Stone, Chefs Sang Yoon and Douglas Keane bring together their love of Asian cuisine with the incredible produce of the Napa Valley. The restaurant is located in the historic Freemark Abbey, a legacy winery renowned for its participation in the Judgment of Paris of 1976, a blind tasting which catapulted Napa Valley onto the world wine stage. The chefs have combined local farm products with Japanese-inspired flavors and techniques to create a unique take on a Napa Valley fine-casual restaurant. \u201cWe're taking the traditional Binchotan [a type of charcoal traditionally used in Japanese cooking], but adding the local oak and grapevine clippings to impart our own special blend of smoke to flavor the food,\u201d shares Chef Sang Yoon. If you stop by on a Monday, try a bowl of their ramen, for something unique to Wine Country. 3020 St Helena Hwy North, St. Helena CA 94574, (707) 302-3777 Gott's Roadside Courtesy of Facebook: Gott's Roadside For a different take on a roadside diner, visit Gott's Roadside. Burgers are always better when created with the farm-fresh produce of Wine Country, and Gott's makes it a specialty. From 100% beef franks to beer-battered onion rings, from Ahi Poke tacos to hand-spun milkshakes from the San Francisco-produced Three Twins, enjoy the elevated diner offerings alongside a glass from their California-centric list of wines and beers. 933 Main Street, St. Helena CA 94574, (707) 963-3486 The Model Bakery Courtesy of Facebook: Model Bakery It's something else to see piles of fresh baked goods behind the glass at The Model Bakery, a mainstay of St. Helena for close to 90 years.

        "title": "Treat Yourself with Mud and Minerals in Calistoga",
        "text": "On a recent trip to Wine Country, I was convinced to go not only to sip on the best cabs and pinots Napa Valley had to offer, but to get down and dirty with a mud bath spa treatment from MoonAcre Spa and Baths at the Calistoga Motor Lodge . Framed by vineyards and bike trails, with underground, geothermal hot springs of mineral water, Calistoga has a renowned history as a place of healing. Over half a century ago, members of the Wappo tribe were the first to discover a natural volcanic hot spring near the foot of Mount St. Helena. The rest, as they say, is spa-history, with patrons coming from far and wide to partake in the curative powers of Calistoga, by relaxing in a mineral hot spring or a volcanic mud bath. Courtesy of Calistoga Motor Lodge and Spa, Aubrie Pick The latter was what I had signed up for, though upon arrival, I was informed that enjoying MoonAcre's \u2018mudocracy' was less a mud bath than it was a playful, mix-your-own mud bar. The new take on an age-old health ritual fit right in with MoonAcre's updated and unbuttoned aesthetic and vibe. Still, it relinquishes none of the luxe factors you'd want in a spa, such as a selection of massages, facials, luxurious products, as well as specialty treatments starring Calistoga's famed mineral water. Modeled after a classic bathhouse, MoonAcre Spa and Baths puts a quirky spin on mineral springs and therapies from around the world. The spa features seven treatment rooms, and several, such as the changing room and the steam room, are covered in a soothing palette of soft mint and deep blue pool tiles, encouraging a deep-seated relaxation no matter your chosen experience. Courtesy of Calistoga Motor Lodge and Spa, Aubrie Pick Just outside the changing rooms, I sip a cold glass of lemon-cucumber water and admire the wall of words that advises snake oil and other restorative libations. The tongue-in-cheek signage tickles my writerly fancy (elsewhere, in a similarly tiled soak room with four standalone clawfoot tubs, a sign labeled \u2018Pool Rules' advises patrons \u2018do not attempt duet event without partner'), though it is perhaps not for anyone who can't laugh a little at life. The MoonAcre spa itself is set serenely away from the bustle of the lodge, in a secluded area of the property. The spa is larger than it looks from the outside, with a large enclosed garden and patio area, with plenty of lounge furniture for quiet sunning. I catch a glimpse of the egg-shaped Acapulco and imagine myself lounging on it in the sun with one of MoonAcre's mimosas or glasses of mulled wine, before reminding myself that I'm here to draw the toxins out, not imbibe them in. Courtesy of Calistoga Motor Lodge and Spa, Aubrie Pick A spa attendant arrives to escort me and my spa-mate to the outdoor sink, where she has set out two pails of dirt. What I learn, however, is that this isn't just any garden variety dirt \u2014 this stuff is from France, and when mixed properly, becomes Green French Clay and White Caroline Clay. She reiterates that this won't be a traditional mud bath. I don't particularly mind, since those require me to be neck deep in a tub full of ash, peat, and mineral water, waiting for the heat \u2014 generated by my own body and insulated by the mud \u2014 to draw out the toxins in my skin. To be absolutely transparent, I've never done a traditional mud bath, but I vastly prefer this DIY mud bar experience, since the mud is created in small, fresh batches, and I can still enjoy a full range of motion while waiting for my skin to purify. Patiently, the spa attendant instructs us on how to properly cover ourselves with the clay. The White Caroline is for the face and neck and other sensitive areas, such as under our arms or behind our knees, an area of skin that, up until this very moment, I had given zero consideration. The green clay is for everywhere else, and we're encouraged to really coat it on. Courtesy of Calistoga Motor Lodge and Spa, Aubrie Pick She shows us to the steam room, since the winds outside make it too cold to lay out in the darling patio garden. Inside, the air is a visible, white mist, and we giggle as we start smearing white clay on our faces, unsure if we are doing it right. We realize that we have been given permission to cover ourselves with mud and commit with enthusiasm. The white clay is fine and goes on smoothly, like an expensive night cream. The green clay is chunky and cool and gloriously gloopy, and we slather it onto ourselves before laying down, mud-side up, basking in the eucalyptus scented steam. My spa-mate immediate zones out with a cool towel over his eyes, so I am left to amuse myself. I check to see how the clay is doing, and in lifting my legs, discover that the color of the clay on my skin matches the beautiful green pool tile. I say as much to my spa-mate, and get nothing in response. My fingers slip and slide, redistributing the mud and coloring my legs, an experience remarkably like the fingerpainting sessions of my childhood. After ten or so minutes, we go outside to rinse off the mud in the outdoor showers, where the spa attendant has also set fresh bowls of clay for us to paint our front sides. By now, the wind has died down considerably, so we opt to paint ourselves out in the enclosed patio. We take turns, each one laying face-down on the teal pool chairs as the other literally paints on the clay. It's fun and whimsical in a way I hadn't expected, taking a clean paint brush and using long brush strokes to color my spa-mate's back, wrist up, wrist down, coloring inside the lines of my fellow mud-adventurer's silhouette. Courtesy of Calistoga Motor Lodge and Spa, Aubrie Pick When both of our backs are coated with clay, we lay on our towels, ready to bake. It takes surprisingly little time for the mud to harden, and soon the back of my arm looks like it has developed an advanced state of Greyscale. Back into the eucalyptus mist we go, laying on our stomachs, and I watch as the baked clay on my arm slowly rehydrates over the course of our second steam session. Feeling utterly relaxed, I look out at the garden through the glass doors, and note dreamily the quality of the world through the condensation-heavy panels. The steam room meditation ends all too soon, as there is another pair that has booked the mud bar experience after us, but I can hardly complain because I am zen. After a luxurious wash in the rainfall shower (make sure it's a good one \u2014 the clay ends up in rather unexpected places), in which I use all the in-house, grapefruit-scented products, it's time to head home, driving through Napa Valley but already dreaming about my next Calistoga spa trip. 1880 Lincoln Ave, Calistoga, 94515, (707) 942-0991 \u2014 Best Places to Detox in Napa Valley \u2014 \u2014 The Perfect Napa Valley Itinerary for First-Time Visitors \u2014 Author Julia Chang Julia Chang is a writer based out of San Francisco, California.

        "title": "Where to Fuel Up for the 2018 Napa Valley Marathon",
        "text": "The 40th Annual Napa Valley Marathon is almost upon us, and perhaps brings the perfect opportunity for a balanced vacation, combining the rigorous activity of running 26.2 miles (or cheering loudly for your runner from the sidelines) and the ultimate indulgence of the best hotels and spas and restaurants in Wine Country. And since you can't be at your peak performance without giving your body a little tender loving care, know that with everything that the world-renowned Napa Valley has to offer, you'll be able to feast and rest your head in style. For your visit, stay and dine along the marathon path, or choose a more peaceful pocket of the valley, away from the adrenaline and sustained athleticism. After all, with the number of places to fuel up here, it takes more than one kind of stamina to try them all. Eat Your Fill Solbar Courtesy of Solbar Solbar is a contemporary gem of a restaurant located inside the luxe Solage resort in Calistoga, the north end of Napa Valley. Dine al fresco beneath a canopy of foliage and globe lights, enjoy a drink by the zen fireplace, or even play a game of bocce ball at this restaurant. Whether you're preparing for the marathon, or just there for moral support (and therefore capable of indulging in restaurants in your spare time), there's an item on Solbar's balanced menu for everyone, with healthy, lighter food options for every hearty, indulgent dish available. 755 Silverado Trail N, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 226-0850 Auberge du Soleil Courtesy of Facebook: Auberge du Soleil Ready to indulge? In Rutherford, opt for a luxe dining experience at the award-winning Auberge du Soleil. Founded over 35 years ago, the restaurant was one of the first fine-dining establishments in the area, paving the way for elevated Napa Valley cuisine. The dishes are vibrant and beautifully plated, each an edible work of art competing with the natural beauty visible from the dining table, as diners enjoy the sweeping views of the valley from the terrace. Chef Robert Curry's Mediterranean-inspired food showcases the rich seasonal produce of Napa Valley, and he has procured one of the most extensive wine cellars in the area. The six-course tasting menu will set you back a pretty penny, but you can also choose to dine a la carte at the restaurant for lunch or dinner, and delight your palate at a much lower cost. 180 Rutherford Hill Road, Rutherford, CA 94573, (800) 348-5406 Bottega Courtesy of Facebook: Bottega Bottega is located in a bustling part of Napa Valley, with Bouchon Bistro, Bouchon Bakery, Ad Hoc, and The French Laundry all within a half mile radius. Nab a seat on the outdoor patio, if you can, and enjoy the activity of Yountville's busiest corner over your dish of Italian-Californian fare. Billed as \u2018where Italy meets Napa Valley', Chef Michael Chiarello brings together traditional Italian family recipes prepared with a California twist. The brodetto is personal favorite, with fresh seafood and a white wine tomato broth, fragrant with saffron, and perfect with a glass of wine. Grab one of Chef Michael Chiarello's cookbooks, which they sell on site, to try your hand at these delicious dishes at home. V Marketplace, 6525 Washington Street, Yountville, CA 94599, (707) 945-1050 Addendum Courtesy of Facebook: ad hoc & addendum Addendum is the footnote to Thomas Keller's Ad Hoc family. It serves a limited menu of boxed lunches to go and is the perfect place to pick up his famous fried chicken (a long brine in a fragrant concoction of lemon, honey, garlic, and spices before its dipped into buttermilk and and friend to golden perfection). There are few things on this earth better than a perfect piece of fried chicken, and at under $20 a pop, it's hard to beat. It's take out only, so take it to go or have a little picnic in the nearby park with a bottle of wine or pop to share. The shop usually goes into hibernation during the winter, but opens up just in time for the spring. 6476 Washington Street, Yountville, CA 94599, (707) 944-2487 Bouchon Bakery Courtesy of Bouchon Bakery Give in to your sweet tooth at Bouchon Bakery. You won't have a problem with finding this Yountville favorite, especially since you'll be able to see the line of people out the door and sometimes down half a block. Aside from their beautiful, photogenic macarons, which are a crowd favorite, their flaky croissants are ideal for a breakfast on the go. Pick up a chocolate almond one and an espresso and walk off last night's indulgences. If you're feeling guilty about leaving your canine baby at home while you've been indulging, Bouchon has snacks for your pup too \u2014 talk about a dog treat , you feel me? 6528 Washington Street, Yountville, CA 94599, (707) 944-2253 Mustards Grill Courtesy of Facebook: Mustards Grill Mustards Grill is the sleeper of the group, but always delivers. Located squarely between Oakville and Yountville, on a quiet stretch of Napa Valley's Highway 29, the restaurant might look nondescript on the outside, it's always packed. If you're the type who likes to eschew such conventionality as reservation-making, fear not. There's a small but serene patio around the back corner; order a drink at the bar and enjoy some rays. If you're tired of wine and want something to jumpstart your palate, the mixologists at Mustards Grill makes a gloriously spicy Bloody Mary. Inside, the atmosphere is casual and friendly. Portions are large, so don't be afraid to share if you see several menu items that sound interesting. If I could make just one suggestion, it would be for the Famous Mongolian Pork Chop. 7399 St Helena Hwy, Napa, CA 94558, (707) 944-2424 Ristorante Allegria Courtesy of Ristorante Allegria Whether you want to load up on the carbohydrates the night before the race, or to reward yourself with a carby meal after the fact, look no further than Napa's Ristorante Allegria. The traditional Italian food at this restaurant is top notch, with every type of pasta you could think of. Located near the Napa Valley Marathon finish line, it's an ideal place to lounge and fuel up after your 26.2 miles. The outdoor patio, which looks like it was plucked up straight from an Italian courtyard, doesn't hurt either. 1026 1st Street, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 254-8006 Sleep Tight Up Valley Inn & Hot Springs Courtesy of Up Valley Inn & Hot Springs Once you've had your fill at the many restaurants, it's always best to give in to your food coma in comfort. The UpValley Inn & Hot Springs is located right at the starting line of the marathon, in an area that locals affectionately call \u201cUpValley\u201d. This boutique hotel is perfect for those who need be ready to run at the crack of dawn, as well as those who have come to Napa to support their friends and family. Take a relaxing dip in the swimming pool and whirlpool, which are both 100% fed by natural mineral water. Or unwind with a soak in the Inn's geothermal hot springs post-race and post-food, in the \u2018healing waters' of Calistoga for some indulgent spa time. 1865 Lincoln Avenue, Calistoga, CA 94515, (707) 942-9400 Meadowood Napa Valley Courtesy of Meadowood Napa Valley For even more intimate seclusion, look no further than a stay in the ultra luxe private estate of Meadowood Napa Valley. Revel in the sprawling green beauty from your room's deck or terrace, or utilize the estate's many croquet lawns, tennis courts, golf course, driving range, or swimming pools for a bit of activity before you partake in the daily wine reception. Treat yourself to a luxurious all-suite spa or a three Michelin-starred meal. Chef Christopher Kostow wows with his modern American tasting menu at The Restaurant at Meadowood. With all that Meadowood has to offer, you could conceivably spend all weekend ensconced within this expansive property and still experience an amazing Wine Country getaway. 900 Meadowood Lane, St Helena, CA 94574, (877) 963-3646 Rancho Caymus Inn Courtesy of Rancho Caymus Inn Nestled in the idyllic hamlet of Rutherford, Rancho Caymus Inn is a boutique hotel that was originated by renaissance woman Mary Tilden Morton, of Morton Salt family fame.

Milliken Creek Inn was a stagecoach stop in the mid-1850s on what is now the famous Silverado trail.

Afterwards, you'll have the entire day free for wine tasting around Wine Country or just hanging out in your room for some Netflix and Chill. Couple's Dinner at the Silverado Cooking School 552 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94559, (707) 927-3591 Wednesday, February 14, 2018, 6-9pm Cost: $275 per couple Most couples would likely prefer to let a professional handle the cooking on Valentine's evening, but if you're looking for a fun, non-traditional way to celebrate, why not make dinner together? This unique experience begins with a hands-on cooking class, where you and your date will work together (under the supervision of a highly-trained chef) to prepare a three-course, seasonal menu all while learning savvy, new kitchen techniques along the way. Afterwards, you'll sit down to enjoy the delectable results of your hard work paired with a couple glasses of vino. If this option doesn't work, there are three other cooking and wine classes to look into during your Valentine's Day vacation. The Silverado Cooking School is also offering an All Things Chocolate class on February 9, 2018, and The CIA at Copia will be hosting a Valentine's Day-themed, interactive dinner event on February 10, 2018, in addition to a Valentine's Day Bubbles for Every Occasion class on all things sparkling wine. The Art of Chocolate at the Napa Valley Museum 55 President's Circle, Yountville, CA 94599, (707) 944-0500 Saturday, February 10, 2018, 5:30-7:30pm Cost: Free It's not Valentine's Day without chocolate, and Napa Valley's finest and most talented local chocolatiers have taken on the challenge of creating seriously-sweet works of art to put on display for a special event at the Napa Valley Museum. At the Art of Chocolate celebration you'll learn about the history, process, and artistry involved in chocolatiering and indulge in wine and chocolate tastings (for purchase). We promise it'll taste 100 times better than anything you'll find in a store-bought, heart-shaped box. Head over to Yountville early and visit a couple of the many downtown wine tasting rooms, like Ma(i)sonry Napa Valley and Stewart Cellars . \u2014 The Perfect Napa Valley Itinerary for First-Time Visitors \u2014 \u2014 Meet the Chefs Behind Some of Napa Valley's Best Restaurants \u2014 Author Jess Lander Jess Lander is a freelance wine, food and travel writer based in Napa Valley and exploring all things California wine country.

        "title": "Meet the Chefs Behind Some of Napa Valley's Best Restaurants",
        "text": "Napa Valley may be known for its wine, but world-class dining is right on par. With abundant eateries speckling the landscape and restaurants ranging from Michelin-starred to delicious roadside stops, there's a reason why foodies venture to Wine Country to eat their fill. There's a passion for food here, partially because of the bounty of delicious year-round produce and artisanal products, partially because Napa Valley has become a mecca for inventive cooking. But, the region wouldn't have left its food-centric mark without talented chefs opening restaurants and calling Wine Country home. We've tapped the creative culinary minds of four top Napa Valley chefs, curious to learn about their personal connection to food, the region, and their recommended local favs (beyond their celebrated restaurants) for travelers making their way to northern California Wine Country. Chef Charlie Palmer Image: Paige Green You can find him in Napa Valley at Harvest Table and Charlie Palmer Steak . What inspired you to get into cooking? When I was in high school, I enrolled in Home Ec class on a dare from the football team. I thought it was a great opportunity to be one guy in a big group of girls, but I ended up loving it. My teacher, Sharon Crain, was my inspiration, and I still talk to her regularly and just put her Christmas card in the mail. If not cooking, what else would you do? I definitely keep busy. I'm in the kitchens a lot, but I'm also on a plane back and forth to NYC, Vegas, and more just as much. I also try and jog most mornings, whether that's in Healdsburg or in NYC or somewhere in between. In addition, I've got 4 sons, grown now and ranging from 20 \u2013 24, but I try and spend as much time with them and my wife Lisa as possible. What's your current favorite ingredient or dish? I'm a huge fan of game birds, always. Especially in the winter. Right now I'd really like a roast quail. How would you pair it? I'd pair it with a really rich pinot. I think the gaminess and richness of the meat need a more robust pinot than a lighter one. What's your greatest extravagance? I'm not really an extravagant guy, but I do love to travel with my family. My wife Lisa and I go to Paris once a year. We're headed there in January, and we always stay at the Hotel Le Bristol . What's your favorite Napa Valley wine to enjoy at home? So hard to choose just one, but if I'm drinking cabs, I usually go for Silver Oak or Raymond . On the white side, I'm usually a sauvignon blanc or chablis drinker, so Whitehall Lane or Twomey . What would be three places you'd recommend for first time Wine Country visitors? Raymond . It's a trip and unlike any other winery or tasting room in Napa. Go visit the new CIA Copia . And finally, this is somewhat shameless self promotion, but this is what I would tell anyone who asks: come visit us at the new Charlie Palmer Steak at the brand new Archer Hotel Napa . The happy hour deal is incredible! Follow on Instagram @chefcharliepalmer Chef Christopher Kostow You can find him in Napa Valley at The Restaurant at Meadowood and The Charter Oak . What inspired you to get into cooking? While working the register at a music festival, I quickly realized all the fun was happening in the kitchen. After frying chicken for several summers and graduating from college, I decided I wanted to immerse myself into the culinary world and I began working in restaurants from California to France. If not cooking, what else would you do? Be a nomad. What's your current favorite ingredient or dish? Probably the new seasonal Dungeness crab dish at The Charter Oak. It's grilled and served with Mendocino sea lettuce butter and toasted garlic babka. How would you pair it? Mad Fritz Beer . We've partnered with Nile Zacherle to create a selection of beers designed to match the flavors of our menu. Nile ferments the beer with an assortment of wild and foraged ingredients from our farm and from local growers. If you're not in the kitchen, where would we find you? You would find me spending time with my wife, Martina, and two daughters, Daisy and Lulu. What's your favorite Napa Valley wine to enjoy at home? There are so many amazing wines coming from the Napa Valley right now from both established and upcoming vintners. We like to support everyone, but we tend to drink more white wine varietals at home. What would be three places you'd recommend for first time Wine Country visitors? Bothe State Park where the old Bale Grist Mill is, hiking up Oat Hill Mine Trail , and scheduling a walking tour with one of the local historical societies. Follow on Instagram @ckostow Chef Christopher Cosentino Image: Mark Mediana You can find him in Napa Valley at Acacia House . What inspired you to get into cooking? I started cooking as a young kid in New England, working on commercial fishing boats and helping my great grandmothers, Rosalie and Helen, cook. It was so amazing to have two people who brought so much joy to people through food, whether the food was Italian or new England specialties, it was always made from scratch and with love. That was the game changer for me, everything made sense from there. If not cooking, what else would you do? If I wasn't cooking, I'm not sure what I would be doing. As a young man, I had dreams of being a pro-athlete. In my late 20's, I tried going pro as a cyclist but that was derailed due to injury. The whole time I was racing, I was working in the kitchen \u2013 I was working two full time jobs at once! What's your current favorite ingredient or dish? Right now, I am enjoying working with chicories. They are so delicious and a true winter specialty. I also love castelfranco, treviso and puntarella, each has a great new use that can be so delicious when paired with rich foods; both seafood or meats. How would you pair it? Pairing chicories would really depend on what they are being served with. For puntarella, I would serve it with fish which I would then pair with a crisp, mineral driven white wine with no oak. For the Treviso, I would pair this with meat and then with a pinot noir. If you're not in the kitchen, where would we find you? When I am not in one of my kitchens, Cockscomb in SF, Jackrabbit in PDX or Acacia House in Napa, I am either spending time with my family or riding my bike. Riding my bike gives me clarity so I can focus on all the things that are important. I find that being out of the restaurant is just as important as being in the restaurant, it gives you real perspective. What would be three places you'd recommend for first time Wine Country visitors? My first recommendation, I would say Terra Restaurant . It's a must go to for sure, the food is always delicious, it's a very special place for me. I think Hiro & Lissa are amazing and a very important part of the Napa culinary scene. I love the Oxbow Market , it's a really cool place to get a great taste of the Valley. You can find local wines and beers as well as local meats, cheeses, produce and products. It's also located in a really central place which gives you access to Napa. I would also recommend Mumm for sparkling wine. They have an amazing view of the entire Valley that you can enjoy while sitting outside, enjoying one of their sparkling wine flights. Follow on Instagram @chefchriscosentino Chef Sharon Li You can find her in Napa Valley at PRESS . What inspired you to get into cooking? I went through a vegan phase in college, which forced me to cook a lot from scratch. My first knife was a butter knife I \u201cborrowed\u201d from the cafeteria so I could dice onions in my dorm. Originally I planned to study art and music, but after many changes in my major, I earned a B.A. in Business Management. I realized that by working in restaurants, I could combine my passion for an environment that fostered both the creative and managerial aspect of the business. If not cooking, what else would you do? If I was not cooking, I'd love to be a world renowned photographer and work for National Geographic or something of the like. Document life as it happens. Or, a spear fisherman. What's been your most memorable experience? It's hard to pick one. Every single day of my life is a challenge. I would probably say it's the late nights at the bar with my sous chefs, when we laugh and cry and let our frustrations and fears go and realize it's just food, and we're still kicking. What's your current favorite ingredient or dish? Cilantro. I almost don't want to be friends with people who don't like cilantro. What's your greatest extravagance? Sushi. Caviar. Tomatoes. Food in general! I will spend $700 on a meal without batting an eye, but question my life existence if I have to fork over $300 for a new TV. Priorities. If you're not in the kitchen, where would we find you? At a taqueria or at a restaurant at the bar, eating enough food for a family of four. What would be three places you'd recommend for first time Wine Country visitors? Besides PRESS (of course), my top 3 places that I personally love and would recommend: Oenotri . Great wine list, charcuterie (get the selection of ten), Margherita Pizza, Mixed Greens salad and creamy polenta with parmesan. Kenzo . Pricey, but absolutely worth every penny. Everything about this place is a choreographed ballet. Beautiful in every sense of the word. La Taberna . Wine bar and tapas, order one of everything. Great late night vibe.

        "title": "The Wine Country Fires Are Out Now it's Time For Wine",
        "text": "Reports of the destruction of Wine Country have been greatly exaggerated. Yes, six major wildfires torched portions of the region in October. Yes, they were scary. And deadly. They caused a lot of damage, burning entire neighborhoods in minutes. But despite the terrible realities in certain places, most of Wine Country is just fine. The fires burned about 199,000 acres, or about 5.3 percent of the 3.7 million acres across Napa, Sonoma, and Mendocino counties. Most of the area devastated by fire was rural or residential\u2014all told, only 3 wineries were destroyed, and fewer than 10 others were damaged to the point of having to close. Now that the fires are contained, Wine Country needs some TLC. Regional marketing organizations on both sides of the Mayacamas Mountains say tourism has dropped since the fires began. The scenes in wineries, restaurants, and hotels across the region confirm these reports\u2014during what is typically the busiest time of year, Wine Country destinations are slower than they should be. Here's how you can help turn the tide. Support the Wineries The easiest way to assist in Wine Country's recovery is to buy local wine. First and foremost, consider quaffing varieties from the three wineries that were destroyed in the blaze: Paradise Ridge , Signorello Estate , and Frey Vineyards . Though the primary tasting and production facilities at each of these three were burned, Paradise Ridge still has a tasting room on Highway 12 in Kenwood, and Frey is available online. (Signorello is distributed through allocation membership.) Hess Winery #withWineCountry Once Santa Rosa's Fountaingrove neighborhood is reopened to the public, it also might be meaningful to visit the sculpture garden at Paradise Ridge , which survived the blaze because the pieces are composed of metal and stone. In the more immediate future, pay a visit to wineries that were damaged in the fires. On the Sonoma side, this includes Gundlach Bundschu and Nicholson Ranch ; on the Napa side, it includes Hess Collection , Brown Estate , and William Hill Estate . To truly spread the love, stop by Ledson Winery & Vineyards in the Sonoma Valley and Regusci Vineyard along Silverado Trail in Napa\u2014flames came within yards of the wineries at each property, and only through great acts of personal heroism did these two wineries survive. Even among those wineries that weren't directly affected by the fires, every penny helps. In many cases, buying wine at these places also indirectly helps local relief efforts, since dozens of wineries are donating proceeds from each sale to charity. On the Napa side, Trinchero Family Estates wineries are donating all tasting fees through the end of November to the Napa Valley Community Foundation. In Sonoma County, Trattore Farms at the west end of the Dry Creek Valley is donating 100 percent of all profits from tasting fees, olive oils, and vinegars through mid-December to local fire relief. The list goes on and on. If you're wondering whether a particular winery is donating to relief efforts, it never hurts to ask. Dine and Stay Dozens of Wine Country restaurants and hotels have supported members of their respective communities since the fires, and these establishments deserve support as well. Many of the worthy restaurants are on the Sonoma side. In Cloverdale, swing by The Trading Post and thank Chef Erik Johnson, who prepared free meals for 200 evacuees on the night the fires broke out. In Santa Rosa, consider supporting Starks Steakhouse , Bird & the Bottle , and Monti's \u2014three restaurants that fed first responders and evacuees for free. Money spent at these latter eateries directly benefits the Stark Reality Restaurants group, which also lost the iconic Willi's Wine Bar in one of the fires. the girl & the fig #withWineCountry What's more, restaurants throughout Wine Country (and the entire Bay Area, for that matter) are participating in a fundraiser called ChefsGiving from Nov. 13-19. As part of this effort, the eateries will offer special menus, and 100 percent of proceeds from the meals will benefit Tipping Point Emergency Relief Fund and Restaurants Care . Eateries on the list include The Restaurant at Meadowood in St. Helena, the girl & the fig in Sonoma, and more. Among hotels, the Napa River Inn in downtown Napa and DoubleTree by Hilton, Sonoma Wine Country in Rohnert Park both deserve special love, since the properties took in dozens of first responders and evacuees for free or at discounted rates, and fed them for days. What's more, Auberge du Soleil , a luxury hotel in St. Helena, will match an optional guest donation of $5 per night through the end of the year; all money benefits the Napa Valley Community Foundation. Donate Direct Another way to help relief efforts is to contribute to them directly. WineCountry Media, the parent company of this website, has created a WineCountry Relief Fund ; readers can opt to donate directly or to donate 5 percent of all proceeds for experiences booked and completed from now through the end of the year. Other worthwhile and charitable relief efforts include the Community Foundation of Sonoma County's Resilience Fund , the Redwood Credit Union's North Bay Fire Relief Fund, the Napa Valley Community Disaster Relief Fund , and the Santa Rosa Junior College Fire Relief Fund , which aims to provide financial assistance to more than 500 faculty, staff members, and students who lost their homes. Go Social Of course the final way to assist with local recovery efforts is to help spread the word that Napa, Sonoma, and Mendocino are open for business. To achieve this goal, Wine Country Media is encouraging readers to tag social posts from Wine Country with the hashtag, #withWineCountry . As another part of this campaign, the team has embarked on a photo journey through the region, sharing scenes from local businesses as they invite visitors to stay, eat, drink, taste, play, and explore the region. They are also profiling a number business leaders to tell their stories of triumph through the fires. Visit the campaign landing page to see the latest. #withWineCountry The bottom line for the next few months: be involved. Wine Country has embarked on a long-term recovery, and the more you participate in this return to normalcy, the more normal life will feel for locals and visitors alike. \u2014 See the #withWineCountry Campaign \u2014 \u2014 Book a Napa Valley Wine Country Experience \u2014 Author Matt Villano Matt Villano is a full-time freelance writer based in Healdsburg, California.

        "title": "Handy Movie Guide for NVFF 2017",
        "text": "Film is like wine in that it's completely subjective. Everyone has different tastes, so to help you pick from the 100+ films that will be screened at this year's Napa Valley Film Festival, we've created this oh-so-handy guide. If You Like Feel Good Stories of Hope and Redemption Check out documentaries Mighty Ground , the story of a homeless man that turns to music in an effort to to kick his drug addiction and break away from the chains of poverty, or Skid Row Marathon , which centers on an unlikely running group of former criminals and addicts that train to run marathons together. Addressing one of society's most pressing young adult issues, I Can I Will I Did is about a bullied teen that ends up paralyzed in a tragic accident, and his quest to walk again. If You Subscribe to the Notion \u201cIf You're Not First, You're Last\u201d Many of these films are having their California or West Coast premiere at the NVFF, so you'll be able to brag to all of your friends about the amazing film you previewed that they've never even heard of yet. Look out for screenings like ACORN and the Firestorm , A Fine Line , and Laddie: The Man Behind the Movies , a documentary about the life of Alan Ladd, Jr., the producer behind Star Wars , Blade Runner and Braveheart . ACORN and the Firestorm Film Still If You Never Miss an Award Show You'll want to grab seats to this year's Core Competition Films, the ones that could bring home some hardware during awards season. Former Red Carpet presentations include Lion , The Descendants , Silver Linings Playbook and Wild . Future winners could be The Gateway Bug (it's about eating bugs), The Year of Spectacular Men , or Tater Tot & Patton , which already has our vote for best title. If You Could Use a Laugh Both on trend with the modern day buzzwords, Amanda and Jack Go Glamping and Life Hack look primed to shake off a long week at the office. Life Hack Film Still If You're Overdue for a Good Cry Man in Red Bandana and American Folk both address the pain and loss surrounding 9/11, so there's no way your eyes stay dry. If You Want to Change the World Happening: A Clean Energy Revolution , looks at the positive impact that clean energy initiatives are having on the globe. Happening: A Clean Energy Revolution Film Still If You Like a Good Political Debate ACORN and the Firestorm centers on ACORN, the grassroots organization that was accused of voter fraud by Republicans during the 2008 presidential election, while Food Evolution will leave you wrestling with everything you thought you knew about GMOs (genetically modified organisms). If You're Always on Your Phone California Typewriter and People You May Know shed light on the impacts of our technologically-obsessed society. Phones must be silenced during the screening, but you can totally tweet about it after. If You're a Feminist Female empowerment is a common theme this year, with films like Catching Sight of Thelma and Louise and Ella Brennan: Commanding the Table . Served Like a Girl gives us a rare look at the suffering and strength of female veterans, and A Fine Line seeks to discover why only six percent of head restaurant chefs are women. Served Like a Girl Film Still You can check out the full list of films and descriptions at nvff.com. Make sure you maximize your festival experience with our complete NVFF Guide. It contains everything you need to know about ticketing, events, lodging and more.

        "title": "Introducing Cucina di Rosa at Charles Krug Winery",
        "text": "Charles Krug Winery 2800 Main Street St. Helena, CA 94574 (707) 967-2229 Iconic Charles Krug Winery has been a staple of Napa Valley since 1861. Located in St. Helena, the winery recently received a magnificent restoration, taking the property's original buildings and upgrading them to world-class tasting and events facilities that celebrate the winery's distinctive heritage with a modern flair. Often at the forefront of wine country innovation, the winery has made its mark since it's founding: using a cider press for wine production, opening the valley's first tasting room, implementing the use of cold fermentation, and being the first in the valley to import French oak barrels, among others. And now, there's a new reason to visit this Napa Valley legend. With their beautiful renovation and the addition of Cucina di Rosa , a culinary program dedicated to the Mondavi matriarch, Rosa Mondavi, and a celebration of the family's Italian heritage, the winery has elevated itself again. Located in the winery's gorgeous Redwood Cellar, aptly named for the redwood slats that line the walls and ceiling, the Cucina is in a shared space with the winery's estate tasting area, with windows overlooking their pristine barrel room. The stunning redwood addition is a continuation of the history of the space, as each slat has been carefully sourced from the original wine barrels used to produce their wares. The winery welcomed Chef Daryl Muromoto, formerly of such acclaimed eateries as Meadowood and the girl & the fig, to craft the dynamic menu that celebrates both his passion and connection to his own part Sicilian lineage and the winery's Italian legacy. The kitchen offers two delicious food options for guests, and the Salumeria and Outdoor Pizza Kitchen are now open and ready for visitors to dig in. Insider Tip: Take a peek into the winery's upgraded barrel room through the large windows on the east side of the building. Here you can see Big Red, the last of the original redwood barrels standing tall and welcoming tour visitors for a memorable selfie. Salumeria Open Daily, 11am \u2013 4pm Truly setting itself apart from other winery food pairing experiences, Charles Krug's Cucina di Rosa's Salumeria is a casual, yet elegant counter offering up cured meat, cheese, and mixed plates in a relaxed environment. Located across the room from their Estate Tasting area, the Salumeria welcomes guests to pull up a chair and sample beautifully handcrafted selections to complement their wines and Italian traditions. Guests can order red or white flights to get a full-bodied experience with the winery's offerings or a glass of their favorite Charles Krug wine to savor slowly as they nibble. Available daily, the Salumeria does not require a reservation. Seating is first-come, first-serve. Insider Tip: Plan on enjoying with a friend and order both a red and white flight to experience the full range of flavor of their dynamic wines. Insider's Insider Tip: Their cabernet sauvignon is worth ordering a glass plus a bottle to take home. Truly one of the best deals in the valley . Outdoor Pizza Kitchen Thursday \u2013 Monday, 11am \u2013 4pm The culinary team at Krug has loaded up a wood-fired oven in the winery's lush backyard to craft delectable, Italian-style, thin crust pizzas showcasing traditional recipes and seasonal flavors. Always offering a crisped to perfection Margarita pizza, the winery's oven will be slinging a vegetarian and meat option as well. Lounge on the lawn or enjoy shaded seating at one of the large picnic tables. While the toppings are seasonal, if you happen to be there for the funghi-topped pizza, we highly recommend it. Signorina mushrooms are excellently paired with roasted garlic, carmelized onions, fontina cheese and truffle oil. Chef flexes his flavor muscles on the salami pizza as well with selections from the Cucina, crushed tomatoes, mozzarella, capers and parsley. We were able to tuck into three (THREE!) excellently baked pizzas, glass of wine in hand on a perfect wine country afternoon. Pairing pizza and wine at this historic estate is a refreshing change of pace from the typical wine tasting. Insider Tip: Plan to stop by Charles Krug during Harvest this fall on September 16th, 2017. The winery will host Italian themed Tastings on the Lawn, an annual event that will include a variety of Italian-themed delicacies, live music, and of course, plenty of their wine.

        "text": "One of our favorite things about working in wine country is our access to incredible food. We also call in a few favors now and then(more now than then) when it comes to recipes to add to our arsenal. The Culinary Institute of America always answers that call with incredible dishes and desserts to tackle. When we're feeling particularly untalented we even stop into a class or two. But when we want to feel really taken care of we stop at their restaurants to experience the best in farm to table dining. While the menus at The Gatehouse Restaurant in St. Helena and The Grove at CIA Copia in Napa are ever changing, we were able to snag a fantastic summer recipe from one of their classes. This Strawberry Rhubarb Crisp comes from their Enthusiast Class: 4 Day Farm to Table Boot Camp. If the idea of baking crusty artisan breads or plating dazzling desserts lights you up. Or you want to explore the world one plate at a time. Or maybe you always yearned to be able to pair wine and food. There's a Boot Camp for you (after all, they offer dozens).

        "text": "When you're seeking the perfect mix of country relaxation and urban convenience, look no further than Calistoga, California. This little city in the country is a great place to get away from it all and still stay connected. Not to mention it's an easy drive from the local airports and only an hour from the heart of wine country, Napa Valley. So if you're in the mood for an easy way to get away \u2013 check out some of our top tips for visitors below. AIR TRANSPORT Image Source: Facebook \u2013 Charles M. Schulz \u2013 Sonoma County Airport (STS) Charles M. Schulz \u2013 Sonoma County Airport (STS) 2290 Airport Blvd. Santa Rosa, CA 95403 P: 707-565-7240 The Charles M. Schulz \u2013 Sonoma County Airport (STS) is undoubtedly the closest you can get to landing in the vineyards, as incoming flights are treated to stunning views of the valley and a private, luxury arrival.

        "title": "Touring Quattro Vino with the Napa Valley Wine Train",
        "text": "Napa Valley Wine Train 1275 McKinstry St Napa, CA 94559 (707) 253-2111 There's a youth quake happening in the Napa Valley region that is morphing it into a hip, must-visit destination for folks of all ages. And the Wine Train is on board, growing their already decadent journeys lunch and dinner trips into full-fledged experiences. The history of the rail line runs deep and the combination of their luxuriously refurbished, vintage Pullman cars takes riders to another era when rail travel was the only way to go. The most exciting rebirth is with their Quattro Vino series. The inaugural journey happened in June 2016, but realizing it's mark as a top, unique wine experience in Napa Valley, they recently extended the series to three new exclusive rides (with another to start in September 2017), each filled with a four-course, Napa-style meal, three distinctive and themed winery stops, and six hours aboard the newly remodeled, chic train. Here's an insider's look into the Estate Tour and a sampling into the newest tour and tasting journeys available on board with Quattro Vino. Estate Tour The Estate Tour is a journey to three of the most picturesque, winery properties in Napa Valley. Showcasing the form and structure of their facilities and highlighting the art, architecture, and distinctive views. Freshly revamped, the Quattro Vino train for the Estate Tour is a modern interpretation on the historic railcar. Marble tables complement simple benches, while quaint succulents bedecking each fourtop. Guests are promptly greeted with a glass of sparkling wine from Domaine Chandon (which is also the first winery destination). Before the train makes its first stop, the Wine Train's talented culinary team showcases the first course with delicious breakfast bites. This tour stops at three wineries beginning with the iconic California sparkling wine house, Chandon. At the winery, guests are greeted with bubbles again(of course!) and the tasting begins with a brief outdoor tour of the surrounding grounds, mock vineyards, and a peak into their eco-friendly practices. The tour takes a playful spin and after a few sips of their wine offerings, the guide will lead you through a mini-Cocktail 101 class, an offering that's available daily on their tasting menu and explores fun and interactives ways to mix their wares. Insider Tip: Take that sparkling cocktail mixing knowledge home with you along with a bottle of their Sweet Star to try out concoctions of your own. After a relaxed and playful tasting at Chandon, the group climbs back on board the train and onto your next stop. But beforehand, a main course(from an ever evolving menu) of Pacific salmon with caramelized shallots, marble potatoes, bacon and asparagus or rosemary and garlic marinated steak with portabello mushroom and sundried tomato farro is served. Insider Tip: While you may be sipping on your stops, The Wine Train has a robust wine and cocktail list. We recommend the The Tequila Mockingbird to complement the steak. Hall Wines is the next destination, and this St. Helena winery boasts more than just crazy good Cabernet, beautiful views and art are in abundance. The tour includes a journey into their on-site vineyards and a peek into the current state of their vines. It's an opportunity to ask questions about winemaking and an exclusive, up-close experience that isn't often part of a typical winery tour. Insider Tip: Members of Hall Wines not only receive generous discounts on their bottles and four shipments of wine per year, but also complimentary tastings for up to four guests. While at Hall, the train made it's turn to head south back towards Inglenook, the third and final winery visit. En route, the Wine Train team takes a chance to cleanse rider's palates with an infused water and savory cookie course, a delightful bite to fuel the continued adventure. The arrival at Inglenook is quite grandiose. Owned by Francis Ford-Coppola since 1975, the last 40 years have been spent reuniting and restoring the historic property and vineyards. The team at Inglenook meets guests at the bus and welcomes with a crisp glass of the winery's wares before taking the tasting inside. The tour continues with Inglenook's Sommelier leading the group into the building's chilly wine caves, a pleasant respite from the Napa Valley sun. Considering the structure, even with its grandeur, has only be used for winemaking, these caves have quite the history. Insider Tip: Be sure to adventure upstairs for a closer look at the beautiful window and the continued impressive film collection from the well-known director. If that doesn't fit your fancy, take your final pour outside to their European inspired cafe offering up additional glasses of vino, cigars, and breathtaking views of the property from their cafe tables. While the tastings come to a close after Inglenook, the Wine Train's journey is not yet complete. The multi-course meal is closed by a two-part dessert as the train continues towards their Napa station, starting with a sensational Hazelnut-Frangipane tart with fresh blended strawberry puree and a fifth course of a Nor-Cal triple creme brie with balsamic fig glaze. It's the absolute icing on the cake (no dessert pun intended) of an epic journey through 36 miles of Napa Valley. Insider Tip: End your railway adventure with one more scrumptious and suggested glass of vino to complement the last two courses. The Wine Train team carefully determines a pairing daily and it's worth taking a sip. Two Other Quattro Vino Tours to consider: >Collective Tour The most exploratory of the Quattro Vino tours, the Collective Tour is a peek into the adventurous side of Napa Valley and wine tasting. The train makes stops at Beringer, St. Supery, and Raymond Vineyards. From wine caves to whimsical properties, this tour will leave guests spellbound and elevate their senses. Legacy Tour With a combined winemaking history of over 300 years, the Legacy Tour celebrates the heritage of wine in Napa Valley. Stopping at established and acclaimed vineyards, the tour is dedicated to the legacy of the wineries and their wares. The Wine Train pulls up to Robert Mondavi, Charles Krug, and V. Sattui on this adventure into the past and is a history lesson guests won't want to miss. Insider Tip: You don't have to be a wine connoisseur to enjoy any of our Quattro Vino packages.

Ironically, we've found a little dirt is the best way to clean away all those worries.

Oat Hill Mine Trail 1800 Lincoln Ave Calistoga, CA 94515 TripAdvisor : 4.5 stars; 21 reviews Image Source: Napaoutdoors.org If the idea of sitting like a quietly meditating lotus is a little too intimidating, try your hand at a walking meditation instead!

        "title": "9 Unique Downtown Calistoga Retail Finds",
        "text": "Being able to play hooky and spend a day in Napa Valley for some retail therapy is a charming luxury exclusive to living in Northern California. Calling on one of my most stylish friends to peruse the downtown retail area, we hit the road at 11am. A stretch of highway and then a couple turns through oak-dappled hills, and suddenly we were parked and ready for a full day spent in downtown Calistoga. A summertime Thursday seemed like the best timing for exploring and tasting the quaint Napa Valley town. Tank Garage Winery 1020 Foothill Blvd Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 942-8265 TripAdvisor : 4.5 stars; 39 reviews Our first stop was a tasting room to get the day off to an official wine country start. We pulled up to the aptly named Tank Garage, which is located in a refurbished, 1930s gas station complete with two pumps and a full width garage dock door open to the street. The interior is stylishly designed with a vintage edge that includes a pinball machine, classic Indian motorcycle, and insanely delicious one-off wines. We were in love with the variety and quality of the bottle art, which is commissioned from world-class artists and designers. The Tank Winery merchandise is perfectly hip and they have sleek branded items like harmonicas, handkerchiefs, and flasks. Insider Tip: Give yourself a reason to go back for their member's only events. Unique occasions like poetry slams, concerts, and community garage sales are all on their upcoming calendar. Calistoga Pottery 1001 Foothill Blvd Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 942-0216 TripAdvisor : 5 stars; 13 reviews Just across the street is the small, but exceptional studio of Calistoga Pottery. Inside we found a treasure trove of gorgeous stoneware and expertise of owners Jeff and Sally Manfredi. They've been creating utilitarian pieces out of clay since 1980, and you can find their work throughout Napa Valley wineries and restaurants. Their small operation allows for the flexibility to experiment with glazing techniques and custom orders. Thanks to their reputation in Calistoga and extensive knowledge of the artform, Jeff and Sally create simple and timeless pottery. From butter dishes to large platters, you can find something for anyone (and even more for yourself) in brilliant colors and a variety of glazes. Insider Tip: For truly unique and entirely Calistoga-inspired dinnerware, ask about their grapevine ash glaze. It's a special (and ever-changing) collection that is glazed with carefully cured and sifted grapevine ash from local winery burn piles after pruning. Lincoln Street Market 1117b Lincoln Ave Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 346-0913 Lincoln Street Market is a multi-room brocante with vintage gems that range from classic farmhouse to gilded European in style. It was easy to get lost in the labyrinth of rustic furniture and housewares, but we made sure to take a moment and enjoyed the courtyard for a seat in the shade. Insider Tip: If you're looking for something to fit your aesthetic or a specific type of salvaged art or furniture, simply call and talk to one of their expert pickers who travel the globe finding incredible collectibles. They've been helping Calistoga inns and wineries find one-of-a-kind elements for years. Blackbird of Calistoga 1347 Lincoln Ave Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 341-3080 We spent the most time in the lifestyle and gift shop, Blackbird of Calistoga. With plenty of interior design items to make your tabletop shine at dinner parties, your bathroom feel like a spa, and your outdoor space lush and comfortable, it's an easy place to retreat to. Select furnishings and fashions range into the more expensive side, but the quality of the materials assure that they'll be around for a long time and in heavy rotation. Insider Tip: Venturing all the way to the back of the store, I found a choice selection of children's toys and infant clothes, making it a great resource for baby showers and birthdays as well. Catch 1365 Lincoln Ave Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 963-7700 Right down the street was a similarly compelling gift and fashion store. Opened by Toss Designs, the small boutique shows off unique handbags, resortwear, party supplies, and cute gifts. With a feminine flair and summer themes officially in full swing, Catch is a boutique for closet essentials and colorful accessories. Insider Tip: Spice up any bag purchase with their monogram patches for immediate personalization. Rove Boutique 1371 Lincoln Ave Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 403-5062 We loved playing dress up in this bohemian boutique. With a great assortment of candles and eclectic accessories, they have a well-curated variety of dresses and casual women's wear. From astrological goodies to comfortable lingerie, Rove seemed to have a little bit of everything for the free-spirited and fashion-forward individual. Insider Tip: We couldn't help but notice the wide selection of local and American-made jewelry. Not to mention that there is a sister store, Gathered (literally, the owners are sisters) in St. Helena with a similar selection of stylish products. Azusa 1422 Lincoln Ave Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 341-3192 At this point, stopping into a shoe store focused on comfort made sense on so many levels. Walking into this small boutique you immediately get the impression that every piece of inventory is selected with care and purpose. Leather sandals, fashionable wedges, simple flip-flops and easy sneakers line every wall. Insider Tip: If there's a specific style or need you're looking for, don't hesitate to ask the employees or, even better, the owner Lisa who is incredibly knowledgeable about the brands and their sizing. Calistoga Olive Oil Company 1441 Lincoln Ave Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 265-6866 TripAdvisor : 5 stars; 29 reviews As the final stop on our downtown retail tour, we wanted to save the opportunity to taste olive oil and spices for very last. Intentionally, the store has adopted a walk-in policy for their tastings, which means no advance reservations needed for the informed staff to guide you through the company's philosophy and products. With an array of different types of olive oil, balsamics, spices, and other fun picnic products, Calistoga Olive Oil has great offerings for chefs and the everyday cook. With olives hand-picked from wineries in the area, it's a perfect local treat to take home to your kitchen. Insider Tip: You can find and taste their olive oil this season at the Santa Rosa Farmers Market with Triple T Ranch and Farm. Additionally, they will be featured as a food artisan at the annual Taste of Napa event in July.

        "title": "Who We're Drinking With: Crosby Roamann",
        "text": "In our \u201cWho We're Drinking With\u201d series we introduce you to some of our favorite people in Wine Country. From winemakers and sommeliers to hoteliers and artists, we're interested in those who are doing things a bit differently. Tired of reading the same ol' questionnaires (do we have to know what everyone wanted to be when they grew up?) we're throwing curve balls in hopes of finding out some new things about these movers and shakers. This week we poured one out with Juliana and Sean McBride of Crosby Roamnann in their chic Crusher District tasting room on the south side of Napa. Tired of awkward tasting rooms that have a few \u201cartful\u201d odes to Italy and uninspired staff? We are too. It could have been the polished concrete floors or the tastefully appointed book shelves, but it was probably the record player on constant spin that put us in the perfect mood to ask some questions and taste some wine. Sean and Juliana began making wine in Tribeca in 2006. Shortly thereafter the wine kicked in and Sean made his way out West. After wine making at White Rock(a breeding ground for young winemakers for over two decades), they started selling their first release in 2010. That's when, as they say, \u201cleft our jobs in Manhattan, sold our apartment in Brooklyn, loaded up the old Volvo station wagon, strapped our baby twin daughters into the back seats, and drove out to California to make a go of it.\u201d The focus of Crosby Roamann's wines are on single vineyard single appellation, hand-crafted wines. You don't get much more personal than their approach. They sort their entire harvest by hand, and ferment everything in barrel. The red wines are pressed by hand using an old basket press. They're the ones you'll sit down and taste with when you book a tasting. You hear family affair so much in the wine industry it's almost become trite. But we're totally digging this family, so much so some of us joined their wine club! Let's see what Juliana and Sean have to say in our lighting round of questions: First thing you thought of when you woke up yesterday? Juliana: Where am I? Sean: My wife snores. Weirdest thing that happened while opening Crosby Roamann? Juliana: We didn't know it would be the catalyst for a cross-country, life-changing move. Sean: The weirdest thing to me is the fact that there is a Crosby Roamann at all. I don't think that we ever dreamed this would be our life even in our wildest imaginings. Favorite wine(or beer) related word? Juliana: Tour de Force, or smooth (with an eye roll). But seriously, someone last week described their favorite wine as smelling like an Italian man. That, I thought, was pretty amazing. Sean: Verve. No idea what it really means. Love to say it. The best hangover hack you've come up with? Juliana: A really greasy breakfast sandwich. And a Diet Coke. Sean: Yes. (Editor's note: Sean wouldn't divulge if he eat Juliana's greasy breakfast sandwich or gets one of his own.) You have to eat a bowl of crickets for $40k, what wine would be the best pairing to help it go down? Juliana: Nothing would help that bowl of crickets go down. Nothing. Sean: I don't know \u2026 are they fried? Or are we talking raw?(Editor: No, they're still chirping.) I'm guessing Chablis. What is the best thought about Napa Valley you've ever heard of? (Quote, saying, conversation) Juliana: Everybody thinks Napa is old, it's not the new frontier anymore. But the truth is, there are so many discoveries still yet to make\u2026like us! If you look, you can find some people doing some really cool things, and doing them well whether they're hip or not. Sean: Thank you Director of Marketing! For my part, there are two places in Napa that will always be special. The first is the rolling foothills that form northern Carneros. If you take Sonoma Highway on your drive into Napa you'll know what I mean. It's a magical place. The second place is north of Saint Helena on the north east side of the Silverado Trail as you approach and then enter the Calistoga AVA. The soils of the Vaca Mountains here have decomposed to a granular, bleached yellow gold, and are infused with all this volcanic rock like obsidian. I simply love the soil here. When I think about Napa, these are the places that I think about. Favorite thing on your menu right now? Juliana: 2013 Reserve Blanc Sean: The 2011 Crosby's Reserve. An unheralded vintage that produced some exceptional wines. And I'm very excited about the 2016s. They'll be on the menu shortly. What's your favorite '80s jam and why? Juliana: \u201cEverybody wants to Rule the World\u201d\u2014 Tears for Fears, OR, \u201cGet into the Groove\u201d\u2014Madonna. Takes me back to childhood! Sean: \u201cJust Like Heaven\u201d \u2013 The Kiss (first crush, you know!?) ; and \u2026 oh god there's this song I love and I can never remember the name too. I'm going to have to look it up and get back to you\u2026 If Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs were to show up what would you have him do? Juliana: Clean out the hold and haul tank. Sean: Yes. What's the most difficult recipe you've ever attempted? Juliana: Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and/or lemon meringue pie (custard is seriously time consuming). Sean is really the chef in our family. I (Juliana) like to make the desserts. Sean: I have an ongoing problem with fish skin. I love cooking fish but I find the skins really difficult. Take salmon skin. No matter what I do it never really comes out right. It gives me cooking anxiety. Where is your favorite place to go on a weekday afternoon when you have no plans or obligations? Juliana: No plans or obligations? Seriously? I have kids. And a dog. So\u2026probably on a hike or Dylan Beach. I daydream about sitting outside at a really cool wine bar in San Francisco or on a rooftop in NYC with a glass of ros\u00e9 on an impossibly gorgeous day. Sean: Crissy Field, San Francisco. Using 3 wine terms, describe your best life Juliana: Playful yet refined, bright bouquet, elegant, long finish. Sean: Complex, effortless, with good verve. Food trend you love? Food trend you hate? Juliana: Weekly changing menus with the season. Foam. Sean: I love the farm to table movement. Not a huge fan of eleven course tasting menus. What is wine for (yours or others) and why: A broken heart? Juliana: Chateauneuf-du-pape (red) Sean: Probably champagne. You know, life's too short?! Or if it was a really bad break up then maybe a syrah. A really deep and concentrated one. A job promotion? Juliana: A special aged white burgundy Sean: Grower champagne, without question, and a good one at that. Right now I am drinking Aubry Champagne, also I never tire of Vilmart & Cie. A hangover? Juliana: Water. Sean: Bulls Blood. (Editor's note: Or you know\u2026a diet coke.) A first date? Juliana: Two half bottles each of a surprising and refreshing white and a pinot noir. Sean: Or two full bottles. A penguin walks through your door right now wearing a sombrero. What does he say and why is he here? Juliana : Surprise! Happy birthday! Sean: \u201cMy name is Inego Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\u201d Napa Valley In 15(ish) Words: Champagne Flute or Pint Glass? Juliana: Pint glass Sean: Flute Pinot Noir or Gris? Juliana: Noir Sean: Noir. Winery or Tasting Room? Juliana: Winery Sean: Winery Fog on the mountains or sun on the vines? Juliana: Sun Sean: Sun Hwy 29 or Silverado Trail? Juliana: Silverado Sean: Always Silverado French oak or steel tanks? Juliana: French Oak Sean: Oak Calistoga or St Helena? Juliana: St. Helena for shopping and restaurants, Calistoga for wine and relaxation Sean: That's a good plan. I'll meet you there. Lake Berryessa or Napa River? Juliana: River Sean: Lake Hennessy. Bike tour or limo tour? Juliana: Bike tour Sean: Limo. French Laundry or Meadowood? Juliana : Have never been to either. Both seem like special one time occasions you should definitely try. Sean: Yeah, we've never been to either. It's on the bucket list. We are, however, well acquainted with the Bouchon Bakery, much to our children's delight. Hot air balloon or Hot Springs? Juliana: Hot Springs Sean: Springs. Brunch cocktail or happy hour cocktail? Juliana: Happy Hour, definitely. Sean: Happy hour. Cabernet in front of a fire place or ros\u00e9 pool side? Juliana: Both sound pretty great. Sean: Cabernet. Napa Bottlerock or Napa Valley Film Fest? Juliana: Bottlerock Sean: Bottlerock. Tacos Michoacan or Taco Addiction? Juliana: Yes, please. Sean: Michoac\u00e1n. Click here to book a tasting experience at Crosby Roamann .

        "title": "Celebrate Sauv Blanc Day With These Napa Valley Picks",
        "text": "The word sauvignon is thought to have originated from the French term for wild, describing how the plant grew freely across the Bordeaux region of France. While Sauvignon Blanc may not be the wildest in the bunch now (see what we did there?), this dry wine's crisp, fruity flavors are begging to be poured and paired, and savored on warm weather days. As it's the most widely planted wine grape around the globe, the diversity in style and taste can be vast depending on location and process of aging and fermentation. Bright, buttery, or complex, in celebration of 2017's Sauvignon Blanc Day on April 24th, we're showcasing seven of the finest and favorites produced in Napa Valley. Grgich Hills Estate 1829 St Helena Highway Rutherford, CA 94573 2014 Fume Blanc, Napa Valley Near drought conditions in 2014 produced an amazing vintage in Grgich Hills American Canyon and Carneros organic vineyards. The grapes thrived with the cooler, Bay Area breezes and slowly ripened while retaining their peak acidity. The fruit was harvested and aged and fermented in an extensive combination of barrels, including 900-gallon French oak, and smaller oak and neutral barrels. This process created a vintage with notes of juicy tropical fruits and spritely lemongrass that leaves a minerality on your tongue with its finish. Hess Collection 1445 Mount Veeder Road Napa, CA 94558 Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc The fruit for Hess Collection's Sauvignon Blanc was sourced from their Allomi vineyard in the rolling hills of Napa Valley. Here the grapes are treated to a warmer, long growing season. Lemon verbena and white peach create an initial aromatic impression, and flavors of citrus and floral citrus blossom continue the rich dance and completes with crisp complexity that lingers. Miner Family Winery 7850 Silverado Trail Napa, CA 94558 Miner Sauvignon Blanc Napa Valley This fresh Sauv Blanc is best sipped young. A blend of grapes from vineyards in both Rutherford and Oakville have developed the aromatic notes of stone fruit and herbs associated with this youthful wine. Aged and fermented in stainless steel, this fruity wine is dynamic, crisp, and refreshing. Provenance Vineyards 1695 St Helena Highway St Helena, CA 94574 2015 Provenance Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc Rutherford Provenance Vineyards Sauv Blanc 2015 vintage has distinctive notes of tropical fruit and grapefruit with an additional intensity of bright layers of citrus flavors. Grapes were grown and plucked at their top maturity from vineyards from the Rutherford AVA. Aged in both stainless steel tanks and French oak barrels to create a creamy complexity with hint of oak spice, this wine lays heavy, yet silky, on the tongue, and mingles flavors of sweet, lively fruit and floral aromas. Flora Springs 1978 Zinfandel Lane St Helena, CA 94574 2015 Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc 2015 was a year of low yields, but high quality fruit for Flora Springs. Their 90 point Sauvignon Blanc has intricate layers, celebrating the nature of the harvest. Bright and fruity, citrus and passion fruit are the key flavors aligning with a subtle floral quality. Mid-palate, drinkers experience a nutty quality alongside nuances of ginger that concludes with a bit of spice and minerality. Flora Springs suggests this vintage to be best enjoyed by 2019. Insider Tip: Sauvignon Blanc pairs best with delicate, fresh seafood, tangy dairy elements, green, spring vegetables, and soft cheeses, especially goat cheese. Plan an early evening tasting menu and enjoy this crisp, herby white while taking in warmer days and celebrating your own Sauv Blanc day. Tag your images #SauvBlanc on April 24th to document and cheers your own version of this international wine day. Author blogger LOVE THIS CONTENT?

        "text": "When the day is done and our work is over, you've earned a moment to sit at the bar or on the patio, and decompress with a cocktail. Somehow it always tastes more delicious when it's a couple bucks cheaper than usual. Here are our Happy Hour recommendations in downtown Napa and the beautiful Instagram photos snapped to give you some inspiration for your next five o'clock outing. Ang\u00e8le 540 Main St, Napa, CA 94559 (707) 252-8115 Image Source: tysoncaly Sun's out, get out! And make sure to stroll down towards the river and stop in at Ang\u00e8le. The French brasserie is known for their seasonal menus and unique cocktails. If gin or vodka is your jam, try their housemade tonic for a delicious fizzy staple in the sun. We can't reiterate how good it is. Insider's Tip: Just in for a cocktail? Order the fries, a generous portion served in (no joke) a flower pot with ketchup and garlic aioli. Cuts the cocktails perfectly. Andaz 1450 1st St, Napa, CA 94559 (707) 687-1234 Image Source: andaz Situated inside the Andaz Hotel, the Farmer's Table is a perfect space to order a Bloody Mary and classic brunch fare.

Come in from 5:00 to 6:30PM for their ever-changing menu of $6 craft cocktails and bar bites for only $5. Some favorites include their Deviled Eggs, with a distinctive arugula & pickled onion blend, and the Green Flash to compliment, composed of gin, green chartreuse and lime. Insider's Tip: Truffles, truffles, everywhere! TORC doesn't skimp on the good stuff, so if you stay for dinner, find the entree with truffles mentioned and order it (without sharing). Ca'Momi 1141 1st St, Napa, CA 94559 (707) 224-6664 Image Source: camominapavalley For a taste of rustic Napoli in downtown Napa, don't miss Ca'Momi. Their speciality is wood-oven pizza but their Happy Hour is molto bene. Come by Tuesday thru Sunday at 5:00 to 6:00PM and a late night happ(ier?) hour on Fridays and Saturdays from 10PM to close. Their \u201cgarden to glass\u201d cocktail menu is not-to-be-missed. Insider's Tip: Trust your bartenders. If you're feeling adventurous, let the cocktail masters behind the bar shake you up something special. Who knows, they might just pull down the olive oil vodka for you. That's right, olive oil vodka. It pairs great with pizza! ZuZu 829 Main St, Napa, CA 94559 (707) 224-8555 Image Source: zuzunapa A decadent small-plate menu with the kind of flavor that only Spain can supply and the produce and products Napa is known for, ZuZu is a great after-work spot when you're in need of some top-notch tapas. Always order their homemade red Sangria to send off the workday properly. Insider's Tip: Yes the Sangria is incredible. But we had to break in regular (cocktail) programming to show you what to pair with it. Whatever else you eat, you must order the boquerones. In fact, we always order two. Hog Island Oyster Bar 610 1st St Napa, CA 94559 (707) 251-8113 Image Source: hogislandoysterco Located in the Oxbow Public Market, Hog Island Oyster Co. is the ultimate name in Northern California oysters. Stop by for their happy hour specials from 5:00 to 7:00PM on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Try the harissa saut\u00e9ed shrimp and of course, all the oysters. Insider's Tip: While they have an array of local wine, beer and sparkling beverages, you can also bring your own bottle of your favorite something. Corkage fee is $15, and they graciously provide glasses and an ice bucket to keep it cool. La Taberna 815 Main St, Napa, CA 94559 (707) 224-5551 Image Source: latabernanapa Looking for extraordinary food and a hip vibe? Head over to La Taberna for tapas and a classic Rebujito, which is a traditional cocktail with La Guita Sherry, Atxa Blanca Vermouth, lemon juice and seltzer.

        "text": "From January until the end of March the Napa Valley erupts in a riotous carpet of yellow. Forget summer in the valley or even harvest, this time of year is mustard season! While the Napa Valley is technically in it's \u201cslow season\u201d this is an incredibly beautiful time to visit wine country. The tasting rooms are less busy, there is always a seat waiting for you in front of a fireplace or two and then there are the views. As far as the eye can see, large swaths of this colorful flower fill the gaps between the grapevines, it truly is a Napa Valley must see. The Napa Valley Register recounts the story of the mustard flower's origin: \u201cThis profuse plant with its cheerful flowers is not indigenous to Napa County. While proven to be a beneficial vineyard cover crop today, its seeds are thought to have been equally as beneficial for a directionally challenged early-1800s explorer. In 1823, the first Spanish and Mexican exploration party entered Napa Valley. Its goal, purportedly, was to find a suitable mission site. A Jesuit priest, Father Jose Altimura. Altimura is said to have introduced the mustard plant into the local landscape. There are two version to this story. The first one claims the priest loved the condiment so much he scattered mustard seeds everywhere he went, including Napa Valley. According to the second version, Altimura was said to have a poor sense of direction. Those who tell this story underscore his inability by saying, \u201cAltimura could get lost in a closet.\u201d Reportedly, Altimura made every attempt to conceal his challenge in order to preserve his job and reputation. The legend claims Altimura would leave a broad, but discreet, trail consisting of a large swath of mustard seeds whenever he had to venture away from the expedition party or their encampment.\u201d To celebrate the end of this season, we rounded up our favorite images of our favorite Napa Valley flower!

        "text": "A Weekend Escape at White House Napa White House Napa Valley Inn 443 Brown Street Napa, CA 94559 Downtown Napa's White House Napa Valley Inn boutique hotel recently reopened with fresh details along with a modern, chic renovation of the historic inn. It may be a new look, but the warmth and charm of this old town landmark is still present, and with the dizzying array of resort-like amenities, White House Napa Valley Inn is a cozily luxurious alternative to a more sprawling lodging option. The 17 guest rooms feature unassuming historic charm and quirky design details. From the polka dot carpet, modern art, and the pop of color gracing every suite, you're bound to find ample Instagram-worthy moments to document throughout your getaway. Natural light and high ceilings encompass each room creating an airy, open feeling to complement each thoughtfully executed design. Tech friendly amenities add to the modern updates and each room is outfitted with flat screens, Apple TV, free WiFi, and USB ports. While their plush beds may be hard to roll out of, the inn's complimentary tapas-style breakfast of sweet and savory delights is worth the tumble down to the dining room. Insider Tip: Breathe in that fresh air and request a King Deluxe Balcony room for an expansive room with walk-in shower and a stunning shared balcony overlooking the front lawn. While the rooms are outfitted for ultimate comfort and relaxation, the grounds are equally an oasis in central Napa. Lush flower gardens surround the manicured lawn and private outdoor swimming pool and hot tub. Laze in one of their reclining chairs under the California sun or on those cooler Napa nights, sidle up to their outdoor fire pit with a glass of your favorite wine country libation. Insider Tip: 5-6pm is the White House Napa Valley Inn's daily wine social. Enjoy sips from local wineries without leaving the grounds after a very productive day of lounging and catching up with your favorite book.

Grab a service solo or lavish with your special someone, and treat yourself to some much deserved pampering. Insider Tip: Want to feel refreshed and invigorated? We recommend a Massage with Facial Treatment. Enjoy the touch of a seasoned massage therapist as they target tension areas, release pressure and stress, and then enjoy an aromatic facial with all the fixings.

Vegetarians and carnivores alike can partake in their ample menu of yakitori and if that's not your bag, try a bowl of their spicy ramen. For that after meal sweet treat, share a milk soft cream on your walk back to White House Napa Valley Inn. Oxbow Market For all Napa has to offer in one location, Oxbow Market is your stop. For coffee, local beer, oysters, fresh produce, cupcakes, books, cheese, ice cream, spices, and the list goes on, and on, and on.

Sink into one of their lush leather couches and see for yourself why the NY Times ranked JaM as one of their top places to visit in 2017. Mark Herold Double the fun with two downtown tasting rooms for Mark Herold Wines. Pull up a bar stool and sip on one of his spicy Cabernet Sauvignons and get to know their friendly staff.

From winemakers and sommeliers to hoteliers and artists, we're interested in those who are doing things a bit differently. Tired of reading the same ol' questionnaires (there's only one James Lipton of Inside The Actor's Studio after all), we're throwing curve balls in hopes of finding out some new things about these movers and shakers. This week we poured one out with Colleen Fleming from Cadet Beer + Wine Bar in downtown Napa. This hip little spot in a chic alley off 1st Street beckons you by the light of their neon sign. Come here to drink and be drunk. No judgement: It's a bar for everyone. After all, isn't everyone just looking for that place where you can drink Champagne and icy cold beers and eat giant plates of prosciutto all night? Am I right? Colleen and her partner Aubrey Bailey are deep in the Napa Valley experience. From culinary pasts at Roux and Cindy's Backstreet Kitchen for Colleen and Redd and Julia's Kitchen for Aubrey (not to mention sommelier post at The French Laundry, which we just mentioned). To say both of these ladies know their stuff would be an understatement. Colleen Fleming (left) with partner Aubrey Bailey Let's see what Colleen has to say with our lightning round of questions: First thing you thought of when you woke up yesterday? Coffee! Weirdest thing that happened while opening Cadet? The 2014 earthquake happened a month in to being open. Since then we've thought nothing can be as bad as that. Favorite wine(or beer) related word? Laser-like. The best hangover hack you've come up with? The best cure I've found, and I can swear by it: Drink less! Let's say you have to eat a bowl of crickets for $40k bet. What wine would be the best pairing to help it go down? Tequila. What is the best thought about Napa Valley you've ever heard? That Napa, compared to other wine regions, is still young. Napa still has so much growing and evolving to do. Favorite thing on your menu right now? Byron Kosuge's Carneros Gamay. This might be the first true Gamay vineyard in Napa (as in Beaujolais Gamay, not to be confused with \u201cNapa Gamay\u201d which was rumored to be Valdiguie). Byron and his wife are great customers/friends of Cadet and they drink a lot of French Gamay, like a lot a lot. We just thought they were a little crazy about Gamay, but this year he revealed that he'd re-planted a vineyard he usually sourced Pinot Noir from to Gamay and was bottling the wine as soon as 2015. What's your favorite '90s jam? Anything from Tribe Called Quest. Everyone loves these albums and they get played a lot at Cadet on the record player. Even the younger generation knows and respects this hip-hop group. It's the best and it works at 6pm or at last call. If Mike from Dirty Jobs were to show up what would you have him do? Clean and mop the floors at the end of the night like the rest of us. I'd love his help. What's the most difficult recipe you've ever attempted? Making wine! It's so fussy. That's why I leave it to the experts. Where is your favorite place to go on a weekday afternoon when you have no plans or obligations? Angele for cocktails or the patio at Bistro Don Giovanni's when the weather is nice Using 3 wine terms, describe your best life. Flamboyant yet refined. Intellectually satisfying. Food trend you love? Food trend you hate? Love Donuts, hate Cronuts What record could you listen to in Cadet everyday for the rest of your life? The first B-52's album. Or any Talking Heads album. It sounds so current. Someone walks into Cadet and asks you to serve them something quintessentially Napa Valley, what is it? To us, an old vine Zinfandel from Biale / Carlisle / Turley. The history in the vineyards speaks for itself. Or a well-balanced and age-worthy cabernet from someone like Corison or Frog's Leap. A penguin walks through your door right now wearing a sombrero. What does he say and why is he here? \u201cI don't know anything about wine. What should I drink?\u201d He's here because everyone else is and because we don't discriminate. Cadet is for everybody. Napa Valley In 15(ish) Words: Champagne Flute or Pint Glass? Flute Pinot Noir or Gris? Noir Winery or Tasting Room? Winery Fog on the Mountains or Sun on the Vines? Sun Hwy 29 or Silverado Trail? Silverado French Oak or Steel Tanks? Steel Calistoga or St Helena? Calistoga Lake Berryessa or Napa River? River Bike tour or limo tour? Bike French Laundry or Meadowood?

        "text": "Inexpensive lodging tends to be rare in world-famous destinations, but Calistoga, the hot springs hamlet on the northern edge of Napa Valley, offers more than a few reasonably priced options without sacrificing basic comfort\u2014or even some perks. Here are eight Calistoga hotels that hit a mix of comfort and charm. A Dose of Minerals Image Source: Yelp Calistoga Motor Lodge & Spa 1880 Lincoln Ave Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 942-0991 TripAdvisor: 4.5 stars, 389 reviews The art-deco style of the Calistoga Motor Lodge & Spa distinguishes it from the fussier hotels around town, but there's more to this hotel than retro appeal. Situated near downtown and the start of the Silverado Trail, a shuttle service makes it even easier to reach surrounding amenities, particularly the diners where you can use complimentary breakfast vouchers provided for guests. Rooms, meanwhile, are stocked with iHome docking stations and mini-fridges full of free snacks. Insider tip: The onsite mineral pools and hot tubs are fed by the same rejuvenating springs that turned Calistoga into a resort town in the first place, so you can enjoy their health benefits without leaving the grounds.

Privacy is the main draw here, whether you're relaxing inside or lounging around your private deck with the pastries, juice and fresh fruit delivered to your door every morning. Don't forget to inquire with one of the staff members about the local winery discounts they frequently offer. Insider tip: If you're worried about keeping a white wine cool for a picnic day, inquire at the front desk to borrow a cooler and some ice packs. Inn Food Image Source: Yelp Calistoga Wine Way Inn 1019 Foothill Blvd Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 942-0680 TripAdvisor: 4.5 stars, 405 reviews Calistoga's oldest bed and breakfast has updated just enough to keep up with modern luxuries without sacrificing its romantic yesteryear charm.

The natural springs are perfect after a trip to the onsite fitness room, while the rooms themselves are comfortable without being gaudy. When you're not in the water, however, their indoor fireside lounge may be the best place to relax. Insider tip: Follow up a dip in the geothermal-heated pool and jacuzzi with a visit to the UpValley Inn's steam room and/or sauna. Old School Spas Image Source: Yelp Dr. Wilkinson's Hot Springs Resort 1507 Lincoln Ave Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 942-4102 TripAdvisor: 4 stars, 391 reviews Another retro gem amidst the modern luxury of Napa Valley (complete with kitschy neon sign), this family-owned hot springs resort offers comfortable, if basic, rooms with all the usual amenities, plus a separate Victorian House with added benefits and a gorgeous veranda overlooking the adjacent streets and mountains. Even so, the three separate mineral baths and inclusive spa treatments like \u201cThe Works\u201d are what elevates Dr. Wilkinson's to something truly special. Insider tip: If you can only afford one spa treatment, don't miss the ever-relaxing mud bath, where you'll float in a pool of warm volcanic ash and peat moss.

Fresh-cooked breakfasts are included in certain packages, while lunch and dinner are reasonably priced and made from fresh local ingredients, some grown right on the expansive and picturesque property. Insider tip: Spend time with the farm animals on a morning hike around the property, which includes a lake, old-growth redwoods and petrified wood that long predates even this historic ranch. Around Town Image Source: Yelp Stevenson Manor 1830 Lincoln Ave Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 942-1112 TripAdvisor: 4.5 stars, 624 reviews It's one of the only franchised hotels in the area, but don't hold that against it: Stevenson Manor offers the sort of luxury common in Calistoga for far less dough than most competitors. The hot breakfasts go beyond continental and the onsite spa services include couples massages and natural spring pools. Most rooms have picturesque views of the nearby mountains, plus balconies and whirlpools available for just a little more. Insider tip: A free shuttle is available to take guests anywhere in Calistoga, but be sure to ask about any discounts available at local restaurants for guests before you go. Despite the discounted prices, these Calistoga hotels all offer a distinct batch of amenities for guests to enjoy during their stay, so budget-conscious travelers to Napa Valley can lounge and sleep in comfort while saving most of their cash for the wineries themselves Author freelance LOVE THIS CONTENT?

        "title": "The Most Expensive Napa Valley Wines Ever Sold",
        "text": "With its long tradition and bevy of talented winemakers, Napa Valley produces some of the most expensive bottles of wine in the world, including the current record holder. The prices aren't just for show \u2014 throngs of wine lovers wait for years on lists, scrub the Internet, and travel to auctions for the chance to get a sip of some of these fantastic, and extremely pricey, bottles. Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon 1992 \u2014 $500,000 Image Source: World of Fine Wine An imperial bottle\u2014six liters, that is\u2014of this vintage sold in 2000 at the Napa Valley Wine Auction for the astounding price of $500,000. Not only did this bottle become the most expensive Napa Valley wine ever sold, it was also the most expensive bottle of wine ever sold, anywhere. Since the proceeds went to charity, it is often kept off \u201cmost expensive wine\u201d lists, but it still fetched thousands more than any other bottle. If you get lucky, you might find a 750 milliliter bottle for less than $10,000, though more current vintages can still be pricey, with the 2010 often selling for more than $3,000. Inglenook Cabernet Sauvignon 1941 \u2014 $24,675 Image Source: K&L Wines, Inglenook Yelp The fact that this bottle was sold for so much is intriguing, because it was produced decades before Napa Valley became the renowned wine region it is now. Still, Inglenook Vineyard proudly calls this red the \u201cwine of the century.\u201d The magazine Wine Spectator backed up the claim with a perfect 100 score, and many Napa Valley insiders consider it one of the best Cabernets ever produced. Film director Francis Ford Coppola bought a bottle in 2004 for almost $25,000 and noted, after having a glass, that the wine had a delightful violet and rose petal aroma. Sine Qua Non Black & Blue 1992 \u2014 $3,703 Image Source: Cult Wine Known as a \u201ccult\u201d wine with an extremely limited production, a bottle of this Syrah from Sine Qua Non often costs more than $3,000. This 1992 vintage was grown by Havens Cellars in Napa Valley, and was produced by the extremely talented winemakers at Sine Qua Non. If you have the cash, bottles of this famous vintage are somewhat commonly available online or from wine dealers. Don't hold on to it for too long, however: you'll want to drink it within the next decade or so. Ghost Horse Vineyards \u201cFantome\u201d Cabernet Sauvignon 2010 \u2014 $1,000 Image Source: Ghost Horse World Ghost Horse Wines and Vineyards, located in the southeastern part of the region, only grows Cabernet. Produced by celebrity winemaker Todd Anderson, one of the most experienced minds in the state, bottles of these Cabernets often cost a grand or more each. Occasionally, Ghost Horse Wines and Vineyards customers love the wine so much, they buy the entire barrel. Depending on the vintage, each barrel, which usually contains 23 cases or 276 bottles, costs between $95,000 and $1,000,000. If you're willing to spend that much, at least know that Todd will likely deliver the barrel to your doorstep personally. Harlan Estate Cabernet Sauvignon \u2014 $800 to $1,200 Image Source: K&L Wines, Harlan Estate As California Bordeaux-style wine becomes more popular on the world market, the prices for bottles of this sumptuous red from Harlan Estates keep going higher. Owner Bill Harlan and winemaker Bob Levy, one of the most respected in Napa Valley, restrict production to a bare minimum, and often release fewer than 2,000 cases each year. A top vintage can easily cost close to $1,000, with a 1.5 liter bottle of 2011 Cabernet costing almost double that right now. Grace Family Vineyards \u2014 $700 to $800 Image Source: Grace Family Vineyards Only growing Cabernet, Grace Family Vineyards introduced the \u201ccult\u201d winery concept to Napa Valley in the \u201870s and has earned raves for almost every bottle released since then. The winery only produces 400 cases of each vintage, and wine lovers who come across a bottle at auction are often willing to pay more than $700 for the privilege of tasting the immensely powerful flavor of these Cabernets. Bryant Family Vineyard Cabernet \u2014 $600 to $800 Image Source: Bryant Family Vineyard Bryant Family Vineyard only produces 1,000 cases of Cabernet every year, and the bottles quickly sell out to the vineyard's wine club members and Napa Valley insiders. On the resale market, these bottles easily cost between $600 and $800, depending on the vintage. Don't think that you can just sign up for the wine club though \u2014 membership is strictly regulated and there is a long waiting list. Only now is the winery adding people who joined the waiting list in 2010 to the membership roster. Sloan Proprietary Red \u2014 $600 to $700 Image Source: Sloan Estate Sloan Estate is one of the most exclusive wineries in the state of California, and is never open to the public. In fact, spots on its mailing list are reserved for only a small number of respected clients who are carefully vetted for the honor. The dense and powerful Cabernets produced by Sloan Estate are highly respected, with roughly 600 cases released each year. The 2007 vintage cost $600 at the time of its release. Exclusivity, skill, and love of wine are what make these bottles so astoundingly expensive. Fortunately, for those who aren't able to drink away a few thousand dollars, there's plenty of delicious Napa Valley wine that won't max out your credit card.

        "title": "7 of Napa Valley's Most Exciting Winemakers",
        "text": "Check out this list of Napa Valley winemakers who are doing new and exciting things in the world of wine production. These are winemakers with a strong point of view who are eschewing the traditional in favor of their own visions. The results taste incredible. Abe Schoener of Scholium Project Image Source: NY Times Former philosophy professor Abe Schoener fell into winemaking after working an internship at Stag's Leap Wine Cellars in 1998 while on sabbatical from teaching. He founded The Scholium Project and produced his first vintage of wine in 2000. Schoener has a radical and fascinating style, constantly questioning the accepted norms of winemaking. Possibly his most controversial wine to date is one released just last year: Blowout, a force-carbonated wine of Verdello and Gr\u00fcner Veltliner. His signature wine, Prince in His Caves Farina, is a Sauvignon Blanc that sits in the skins for three weeks, a production process traditionally used only in making red wine. Benevolent Neglect Image Source: Benevolent Neglect Instagram Benevolent Neglect was founded by two east coasters, Matt Nagy and Ben Brenner, whose winemaking philosophy is to find the best possible fruit, and then do as little as possible to it to create the purest possible reflection of the grapes themselves. Their inaugural vintage was released in 2013, and an age-worthy 2014 Syrah was just released in March. This single-clone, single-vineyard, single-block wine comes from the Las Madres vineyard in the Carneros AVA, and undergoes 100% whole-cluster fermentation. Hardy Wallace of Dirty and Rowdy Image Source: Dirty & Rowdy When Hardy Wallace was let go from his technology sales job in 2009, he sold his home in Georgia, and moved to Napa Valley. This major leap of faith ultimately paid off: he founded Dirty and Rowdy with his wife, and their partners Matt and Amy Richardson in 2010, and the label has had tremendous success. This team makes wine from the best grapes grown at consciously farmed vineyards, with a focus on unique varieties like Semillon and Mourvedre. Check out their 2015 California \u201cFamiliar\u201d Blanc, a white wine blend of Chenin Blanc, Pinot Blanc, Chardonnay, Melon, Roussanne, and Viognier. It undergoes native fermentation and has zero additions. Melissa Apter of Antica Napa Valley Image Source: Antica Napa Valley Bay Area native Melissa Apter began her wine career in the tasting room at Saddleback Cellars, before going to South Australia to work a harvest internship at Torbreck. She then began working at Antica Napa Valley in 2013. After serving as an enologist and assistant, she was promoted to winemaker of Antica Napa Valley in 2015. Today, she specializes in Italian-style wines, like her rich, full-bodied Townsend Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. Austin Peterson of Ovid Vineyard Image Source: Napa Valley Register, Ovid Winery Austin Peterson's love affair with winemaking began years ago \u2014 he made his first wine when he was only a teenager. Peterson was raised in a winemaking family: his father was a grower for Beringer and would later work for their luxury division. When Peterson went to college at UC Davis, he didn't intend to study wine, but an introductory winemaking class changed his mind. After studying winemaking at UC Davis, he travelled the world, working harvests in Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, South Africa, and France. He began working for Ovid Winery in 2006, and after a tenure as assistant winemaker, he was promoted to winemaker in 2011. Peterson is known for taking risks, like creating a Napa Valley Red Blend called A2.7, a 2007 vintage blend of entirely concrete-fermented lots, aged in French oak barrels. Carlo Mondavi of Continuum Estate and RAEN Image Source: Continuum Estate Carlo Mondavi is a 4th generation vintner (he's Robert Mondavi's grandson), but this isn't just a legacy gig for him\u2014he's serious about wine. He's been working in the business since 1996, when he started working at Robert Mondavi and Opus One. After going to school in France and Italy, he returned to the Napa Valley to produce wine. Today, he works alongside his family at his father Tim Mondavi's Continuum Estate , where he produces an exceptional Cabernet Sauvignon, grown on Pritchard Hill. Along with his brother Dante, Mondavi crafts Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir from obscure regions under his other label, RAEN (Research in Agriculture and Enology Naturally). They currently make three Pinot Noirs from three distinct Sonoma Coast sites. Helen Keplinger of Grace Family Vineyards Image Source: Grace Family Vineyards Helen Keplinger's extensive experience working in Europe has had a great influence on her winemaking style. Known for her attention to detail, she was named 2012 Winemaker of the Year in Food and Wine Magazine, and was appointed winemaker at Grace Family in 2014. She also produces under her own Keplinger wine label with her husband, and focuses on single-vineyard Rhone varieties. Her private label 2013 Vermillion red wine is incredible and multi-layered, with only 400 cases produced. These up-and-coming Napa Valley winemakers are just beginning to make their mark in the world of wine. These are the ones to watch \u2014 they're creating innovative and compelling wines, and are sure to be around for many years to come. Author WineCountry Staff LOVE THIS CONTENT?

        "title": "The History of Notorious Napa Valley",
        "text": "Napa Valley is legendary among wine drinkers and connoisseurs of all things luxurious, but the valley's story is rooted in hard work and hard times. Discover the incredible stories of real people and hard-earned success in our quick history of Napa Valley. Grapes Arrive 1839: Settler George Yount was the first to plant grapes in Napa Valley. You may recognize the name from the culinary gem of a town, Yountville, which was named after him. 1861: Charles Krug founded the first commercial winery in Napa Valley. A slew of other wineries opened over the next 20 years, including many that are still open today, like Beringer Vineyards, Schramsberg Vineyards, and Inglenook. 1890s: The root louse phylloxera hit the Napa Valley in full force, killing over 80 percent of the grapevines. The Napa Valley wine industry took almost 100 years to recover. Napa Valley in Trouble 1900-1925: Phylloxera continued to plague the vineyards of Napa Valley. Farmers turned to walnuts and prunes, instead, to make their living off the land. 1920-1933: Prohibition went into effect in 1920, and over the next 13 years, most of the wineries that managed to survive phylloxera closed down. A few were able to remain open\u2013like Beringer Vineyards and Louis M. Martini\u2014by producing sacramental wine for churches. Revival 1944: As Napa Valley recovered from the double blows of phylloxera and Prohibition, seven wineries decided to work together to make the best wine possible. They signed a treaty of collaboration to form the Napa Valley Vintners Association, which now represents 525 wineries and raises over $15 million for the local community each year. 1940s-1980s: Over these four decades, Napa Valley reinvented itself. Inglenook was resurrected, Georges de Latour re-established Beaulieu Vineyards (BV), Louis M. Martini founded his eponymous winery, the Mondavi family built an empire (which included the purchase of the Charles Krug Winery), and Andre Tchelistcheff revolutionized the way wine was made at BV, profoundly affecting a generation of winemakers. 1976: The Judgment of Paris catapulted Napa Valley onto the world wine stage when two Napa Valley wines\u2014Chateau Montelena Chardonnay and Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon\u2014took first place in a blind tasting again the best French wines. 1981: Napa Valley became California's first American Viticultural Area (AVA) Becoming an Icon 1992: The first vintage of Screaming Eagle, which would become the most expensive and sought-after wine in Napa Valley, was released in 1992. The wine was sold at $75 per bottle that year, and now costs over $7,000 per bottle (if you can even manage to get on the buying list\u2014there's currently a 10-year wait list). 1997: This epic vintage, which featured a year of near-perfect weather, resulted in powerful wines that epitomized the emerging Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon style. The vintage as a whole was the most highly scored in Napa Valley's history, and set the tone for the next decade of winemaking. Today, Napa Valley is home to over 500 wineries that create some of the best wines in the world. What does the next decade hold? We shall have to wait and see.

        "title": "101 Basic Wine Facts for the Budding Sommelier",
        "text": "Wine is one of the oldest beverages known to man, and is enjoyed around the world. However, the whole culture around winemaking, wine tasting, and wine drinking can be a little intimidating for the uninitiated. Fear not: we've got a few pointers to make the whole experience go down smoothly. The Grapes Though you'll commonly hear grapes referred to as \u201cfruit,\u201d botanists technically classify grapes as berries since each fruit forms from a single flower. Researchers believe grapes have existed for around 65 million years, and that some of the grape varieties enjoyed by us today are directly descended from these primordial fruit. Humans have been cultivating grapes for 8,000 years\u2014since before recorded history. Archeologists believe the first grapes were grown in Eastern Europe and the fruit spread from there. The Romans are believed to be the first to call different grape varieties by different names. There are more than 8,000 grape varieties known to scientists, and more than 1,300 varieties are currently used to make wine around the world. The grapes at the supermarket\u2014known as table grapes\u2014have much thinner skin and far more seeds than the varieties used to make wine. Vineyards cover roughly 7.5 million hectares (almost 18 million acres) across the globe, with Spain, China, France, Italy, Turkey, and the United States being the top grape growing countries. The largest wine producers, however, are France, Italy, Spain, the U.S., and Argentina. France produced 1.2 billion gallons of wine in 2014, according to statistics from The Wine Institute , a trade group. The U.S. produced just over 830 million gallons. Color In general, the color of wine comes from the grapes used. Reds are usually made from purple or blue grapes, while whites are made from greener grapes. When fermenting red wine, winemakers usually include the skin and other parts of the fruit along with the wine juice, causing the wine to taste bolder and look darker. White wines are made from only the fruit juice. The majority of white wines are lighter and have a crisper, more citrusy flavor compared to reds. Research shows that white wines keep lung tissues healthy. White wines generally have less alcohol and fewer calories than reds. Red wine should be served in glasses with a larger bowl so the bold aromas and flavors can emerge through mingling with oxygen in the air. Wines aren't just red or white: some unique wines are golden, pink, or even orange. Region The region where a grape is grown is an important determining factor in how the wine turns out. Soil nutrients, the amount of sunshine, temperature variations, and the amount of moisture, fog, and other conditions deeply affects a wine's flavor. Grapes grown in sandy soil usually produce less acidic, \u201csofter\u201d wine. Soils with a lot of clay produce wines with deep, bold flavors. Loamy soils, which are usually preferred for growing most plants, actually produce rather flavorless wines. Grapes grown in warmer climates, like the Napa Valley, are usually more ripe when picked, making for sweeter wines. Grapes grown in cooler climates, like the Chablis region in France, will be tarter. Wine regions dot the entire U.S., but the states of California, Washington, and New York lead the country in wine production. California is the fourth-largest wine producer in the world, just behind France, Italy, and Spain. While sparkling wine, meaning a wine with carbon dioxide bubbles, can be grown anywhere, only sparkling wine grown in the Champagne region of northeast France can be called Champagne. How to Taste Although winemakers will claim a wine has certain flavors like blueberries, citrus, or even dirt, wines aren't actually \u201cflavored\u201d with anything. The flavors come from the grapes and the process. Infused wines, meaning wines that have been mixed with other fruit juices, are actually flavored. The first stage of wine tasting is looking over the appearance of the wine. Noting the color and viscosity with your eyes can give an idea of how the wine may taste. For reds, give the glass a quick swirl and hold it up to the light: bolder varieties, like Cabernet and Zinfandel, will leave telltale \u2018legs' that stream down the inside of the glass. The second stage is called \u201cin glass,\u201d meaning that the aroma is noted. Don't be shy\u2014 wine experts stick their nose deep into the glass in order to pick up the complex nuances. The first aromas to hit the nose are associated with aspects of the grapes, while later aromas are connected to the winemaking process and how the wine aged. Take a small sip of wine in order to get a good taste. Don't glug, at least not yet. Roll the wine around your mouth with your tongue and note the different flavors. Pursing your lips and inhaling some air while the wine is still on your palate is also a nice way to spread the more complex flavors through your sinuses. After swallowing, note the aftertaste, which is likely different from how the wine tasted when it first hit your tongue. Draw some conclusions\u2014was this wine too acidic? Too sweet? Too alcoholic? If you want to be a true connoisseur, write down notes. Record the winery, the grape variety, the year, and your thoughts: that way, if you want to return to the same vintage later, you'll have a solid base point for how your tastes have evolved. Pairings Red wines should be served in wider glassware to support oxidation, which subtly supports flavor. White wines can be overpowered by oxidation, so serve in taller, less rounded glasses. Wine is famous for complimenting food, and different wines pair well with different meals. In very broad terms, white wines pair better with fish, poultry, and vegetables; reds go better with red meat. Sparkling and dessert wines generally go best with\u2014you guessed it\u2014sweet foods. Some wineries will print food suggestions on the wine's label. Fine-dining tradition calls for starting with lighter wines, like a Sauvignon Blanc, and then moving to heavier wines with bolder flavors, like a Sangiovese, throughout the course of the meal. As a general rule, white wines should be served before reds; younger wines should be served before older vintages; and dry wines should be served sweeter ones. White wine should be served at 45-50 degrees Fahrenheit, while red wines should be served slightly warmer, at 50-60 degrees Fahrenheit. A good rule of thumb is to put a bottle of red wine into a refrigerator 20 minutes before opening it, and removing a bottle of white from the fridge 20 minutes before serving. To be fully appreciated, sparkling wines should be thoroughly chilled to 43-48 degrees Fahrenheit. Invest in a Champagne bucket, fill it with ice, and dunk the whole bottle in (don't ever open a warm bottle of bubbly). Whether you're uncorking some expensive Champagne in a lux hotel room or sharing a decent liquor store red at a barbecue, these facts will help you buy, serve, and enjoy that bottle. Gone are the days when wine appreciation was a snobby activity\u2014with a little knowhow going in, it's actually a whole lot of fun. Author WineCountry Staff LOVE THIS CONTENT?

        "title": "The Judgment of Paris: 40 Facts for the 40th Anniversary",
        "text": "In 1976, a selection of Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon from California were put up for comparison against their well-established French counterparts. The expectation, of course, was that the French wines would easily win the competition. The sensation that was made when California's offerings easily trounced the competition sent shockwaves throughout the wine industry, and changed the industry forever (ruffling quite a few feathers in the process). This year celebrates the 40th anniversary of that infamous Paris tasting. To commemorate this tasting that changed the world of wine, we've rounded up 40 interesting facts surrounding the event. 1) Things didn't go quite as planned. The Paris Tasting (which would come to be known as the Judgment of Paris) was held with the expectation that French wines were superior to New World (i.e. American) wines. American wines were included to show that interesting wines were being produced, but were not expected to outrank their French counterparts. No one could have expected that this event would revolutionize the world of wine. 2) An Englishman was behind the whole thing. Steven Spurrier, a British-born wine expert who ran a fine wine shop in Paris, was the mastermind behind the whole tasting. He was a champion of French wine, and decided to hold a blind tasting at the InterContinental Hotel in Paris. 3) Steven Spurrier had to work hard to purchase his wine shop. After wandering by the original shop, Caves de La Madeleine, Spurrier proclaimed that he would like to buy it. The owner Madame Foug\u00e8re was hesitant to sell to an Englishman since the shop had been important to her late husband, so they struck a deal. Before she would sell, Spurrier spent six months working there without pay to prove his commitment! 4) The shop offered wine classes. Spurrier decided to start a wine school for American and British expats living in Paris. Along with Jon Winroth, the Herald Tribune's wine writer, the two opened the Acad\u00e9mie du Vin, an English-language wine school. Business was good, so American freelance writer Patricia Gallagher also started working for the school. 5) America's bicentennial had a little something to do with it. Patricia Gallagher told Steven Spurrier about the upcoming celebrations to celebrate the bicentennial of American independence. They thought it would be fun to run a blind tasting that included a few American wines to coincide with the United States' celebrations. They mostly hoped this would bring attention to his shop, but were also excited to show that interesting things were happening in American winemaking. 6) Spurrier wasn't very familiar with the California wines of the day. Although he had tried some of the American wines available in Paris, Spurrier didn't have access to the best California wines being produced. Patricia Gallagher visited the area and brought back a few samples of Napa Valley wines with her. 7) Spurrier and his wife visited California to acquire the wines for the tasting. Spurrier visited California wineries in March of 1976 to find the wines to include in the Paris Tasting. He didn't tell the wineries that he was planning to hold a blind tasting with the wines; he just visited the wineries and made some purchases. He selected six Chardonnays and six Cabernet Sauvignons. 8) They didn't know how to get the California wines to the tasting in Paris. After purchasing two bottles of each wine for the blind tasting, Spurrier had acquired 24 bottles of California wine on his trip, too many to take home as luggage. As a favor, the wines were actually brought to Paris as the luggage of a visiting tour group. 9) The judges were the most prominent French wine experts of the day. Steven Spurrier and Patricia Gallagher graded the wines, side by side with the French wine experts, but the scores of Spurrier and Gallagher were not included in the results. 10) There was no official criteria for grading the wines. The judges were told to grade their wines out of 20 points, yet no specific framework was provided for how to grade the wines. The judges awarded points based on their own criteria. 11) The evaluation was a blind tasting. The labels were covered, so the judges didn't know which wines they were tasting, or whether they were French or American. 12) The tasting included the best French wines of the day. White wines included a 1973 Meursault Charmes, a 1973 Beaune Clos des Mouches, a 1973 B\u00e2tard-Montrachet, and a 1972 Puligny-Montrachet Les Pucelles. Red wines included a 1970 Ch\u00e2teau Mouton-Rothschild, a 1970 Ch\u00e2teau Haut Brion, a 1970 Ch\u00e2teau Montrose from Saint-Est\u00e8phe, and a 1971 Ch\u00e2teau L\u00e9oville-Las-Cases from Saint-Julien. 13) Napa Valley wines took home the prize. Although it shocked the judges, Napa Valley wines outranked the French wines in both the red and white wine categories. 14) Chateau Montelena won the white wine competition. Chateau Montelena's 1973 Chardonnay won first place in the white wine competition. This was only the second vintage of wine produced by the winery. Visit the winery's open house to be held on the 40th Anniversary of the tasting, May 24th, 2016. 15) The grapes for the winning Chardonnay were purchased. As a new winery, Chateau Montelena was in the process of growing new vines that wouldn't produce harvestable fruit for several more years. They bought the grapes that would make their award-winning Chardonnay from grape growers John Hanna, Lee Paschich, and Henry Dick. Most of these grapes were actually grown in Sonoma County, although the wine was made at Chateau Montelena in Calistoga. 16) The winning Chardonnay originally retailed for a low, low price. When Chateau Montelena announced the release of their 1973 Chardonnay, winery owner Jim Barrett recommended a $6.50 retail price per bottle. 17) Stag's Leap Wine Cellars won the red wine competition. Stag's Leap Wine Cellars' 1973 Cabernet Sauvignon won first place in the red wine competition. Warren Winiarski was the winemaker. 18) 1,800 bottles of the winning Cabernet Sauvignon were produced. Stag's Leap Wine Cellars produced 1,800 bottles of the winning red wine, which were bottled by Warren Winiarski, along with the help of his wife and their three children. 19) The winning Cabernet Sauvignon was offered at an even lower price than the winning Chardonnay. When Stag's Leap Wine Cellars first began selling their 1973 Cabernet Sauvignon, Winiarski determined that the bottle should be sold for around $6. Restaurants and retailers were sold 12-bottle cases at $48 each. 20) The tasting launched the California wine industry. After the results were reported, the participating California wineries saw a huge increase in interest. 21) One reporter changed everything. Although Steven Spurrier had invited many reporters to the event, George M. Taber from Time magazine was the only one in attendance. 22) You can read all about it. Journalist George Taber would later chronicle the story in his book, \u201cThe Judgment of Paris,\u201d in 2005, with the goal of \u201csetting the record straight\u201d. 23) Very little was said in the beginning. Only four paragraphs were originally published in Time Magazine about this event that ushered in a new era of wine. The French media wrote dismissive remarks about the event. 24) Grgich Hills Estates has roots dating back to the tasting. Winery founder Miljenko \u201cMike\u201d Grgich was the winemaker for Chateau Montelena in 1973. He then partnered with Austin Hills to create family-run Grgich Hills in 1977. Read Grgich's perspective on the events of his life, including his participating in the Paris Tasting, in his autobiography, \u201cA Glass Full of Miracles.\u201d 25) Warren Winiarski was behind the red wine winner. He was the winemaker of the 1973 Stag's Leap Cabernet Sauvignon that placed first in the red wine competition. 26) The French Judges didn't think the California wines would stand the test of time. After hearing the results, the French judges believed that if the wines were re-tasted in 30 years, the California wines wouldn't be drinkable. On May 24, 2006, simultaneous tastings were held in Napa and in London. The re-enactment proved that California wines pass the test of time. 27) Ridge Vineyards was entered in the red wine competition, and has only gotten better with time. Ridge Vineyards' 1971 Monte Bello Cabernet Sauvignon, from the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA, placed 5th in the red wine competition. In the 2006 30th Anniversary re-tastings held in Napa and London, the wine was ranked number one. 28) Heitz 1970 single-vineyard Martha's Vineyard Cabernet was entered in the red wine competition. Heitz' 1970 Martha's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon was entered into the tasting. When Joe Heitz produced the first vintage in 1966, he included a vineyard designation that was not yet commonplace. He introduced that concept to Napa Valley wines. 29) Clos Du Val's debut vintage of red wine was entered in the Paris Tasting. Clos du Val's 1972 Cabernet Sauvignon was one of the six California Cabernet Sauvignon selected for inclusion in the original tasting. It was only the winery's first vintage of wine! Ten years later, it placed first in the red wine tasting during the 10th anniversary rematch. 30) Mayacamas Vineyards ranked second among the red wines in the Paris Tasting. The Mayacamas Vineyards 1971 Cabernet Sauvignon was included in the Paris tasting, although owner Robert Travers did not think think the wine was ready to drink yet, as it had not even been officially released at the time. Surprisingly, it placed second in the competition. 31) Freemark Abbey was the only California winery with two wines that were included in the Paris Tasting. Freemark Abbey had wines entered in both categories\u2014the 1969 Freemark Abbey Cabernet Sauvignon in the red wine tasting, and the 1972 Chardonnay in the white wine tasting. 32) Chalone Vineyard impressed the judges in the white wine competition, as well as other notable tasters. Chalone Vineyard's 1974 Chardonnay, from the Chalone AVA in Monterey County, ranked third in the Paris Tasting. 20 months later, it placed first in the white wine competition held at the San Francisco Wine Tasting. When Chef Julia Child visited Chalone Vineyard, she reportedly said they had created the first non-French wines that she liked! 33) Spring Mountain Vineyard's Chardonnay ranked high in the white wine competition. Spring Mountain Vineyard's 1973 Chardonnay placed fourth among the American and French white wines at the competition. 34) Veedercrest Vineyards first commercial vintage of Chardonnay was included in the white wine tasting. Although their 1972 Chardonnay was the first official vintage from Veedercrest Vineyards, winemaker Al Baxter was already a passionate home winemaker. A man of many interests, he got into commercial winemaking after studying and teaching philosophy at UC Berkeley. 35) David Bruce Winery was entered into the white wine tasting, but would come to be known for their red wines. David Bruce Winery's namesake winemaker actually worked as both a dermatologist and winemaker. His 1973 Chardonnay was entered into the Chardonnay tasting, but today the winery is well known for its incredible Pinot Noir. 36) The winning bottles are on display. Winning the Paris tasting resulted in the placement of the 1973 Stag's Leap Cabernet Sauvignon and 1973 Chateau Montelena Chardonnay at the Smithsonian Museum. 37) This wasn't just a one-time deal. Numerous commemorative tastings have taken place since the original competition in 1976. A San Francisco Wine Tasting was held just 20 months after the original event, in 1978. Official tastings have also taken place for the 10th and 30th anniversaries. 38) The event inspired Hollywood. The movie \u201cBottle Shock\u201d was inspired by the events of the Judgment of Paris, although much of the story was fictionalized. 39) A new movie is being made about the events. A new film inspired by George Taber's \u201cJudgment of Paris\u201d book is currently being produced. 40) The Napa Valley wine industry has exploded over the past 40 years. Before the Paris tasting, there were approximately 67 wineries in the Napa Valley. Today there are over 400. The Judgment of Paris forever changed the California wine trade.

You could spend a week visiting some of the top restaurants and tasting rooms Napa Valley offers, and never come across the same place twice, without ever leaving the city limits. No matter how long the visit, this list will help you to plan out your trip. Where to Stay Image Source: Yelp Hotel Yountville 6462 Washington St. Yountville, CA 94599 (707) 967-7900 TripAdvisor: 4.5 stars, 767 reviews Check Availability For a luxurious experience, Hotel Yountville is a standard in this quaint town.

Take advantage of the brunch buffet for a late-morning bite, and come back for wine tastings and tea service in the afternoon.

        "title": "The Best Date Night Spots in Napa Valley",
        "text": "For a first date, something lively might be in order. For a fifth date, a dash of candle-lit intimacy sounds appropriate. For a fifth anniversary? An old standard with sentimental value. Whatever the romantic occasion, Napa Valley hosts a variety of restaurants known for their cozy aesthetics, stellar food, and of course, world-class wines. Here's a short-list of some perennial favorites for whichever iteration of date night you have in mind. Wine Country-Luxe Image Source: FARM FARM at The Carneros Resort & Spa 4048 Sonoma Hwy Napa, CA 94559 (707) 299-4880 TripAdvisor: 4.5 stars, 267 reviews Reservations: Highly recommended Located inside The Carneros Resort & Spa, FARM is an upscale American farm-to-table eatery that offers hyper-local fare in an exciting, pairing-centric \u201cdinner tasting\u201d format\u2013a novel take on the traditional prix-fixe. An innovative cocktail menu and an extensive wine list featuring some of the area's finest varieties rounds out the offerings at this seasonally inspired, breezy venue. Book a reservation for an intimate table under the cathedral ceiling of the dining room, or take your drink and appetizer outside to the alfresco lounge for a sampling of the equally refreshing evening air. Insider tip: Arrive before your reservation for a glass of wine and a bit of friendly competition on the bocce court. Relaxed Italian Fare Image Source: Ciccio Ciccio 6770 Washington St Yountville, CA 94599 (707) 945-1000 TripAdvisor: 4.5 stars, 142 reviews Reservations: No reservations taken, but plan for a wait Ciccio opened with a bang in fall of 2012, and since then, this market-turned-restaurant has earned its place on Napa Valley's must-try lists. Needless to say, timing is of the essence in this no-reservations-accepted Italian eatery, but the best things in life, as they say, are worth waiting for. In this case, savory pizzas and sumptuous, sultry pastas in a relaxing, converted general store setting where conversation can dwell for as long as a bottle of a bold Napa Valley red will allow. Insider tip: If there's a wait, snag a cocktail from the dedicated Negroni Bar Menu, which features seven variations on the classic Italian cocktail. French Cuisine Without the Fuss Image Source: Yelp and La Toque La Toque 1314 McKinstry St Napa, CA 94559 (707) 257-5157 TripAdvisor: 4 stars, 336 reviews Reservations: Required Affectionately referred to as a locals' French Laundry, La Toque delivers classically prepared French cuisine in a modern, wood-lined setting, inside downtown Napa's Westin Verasa hotel. A Napa Valley maestro, Chef Ken Frank serves from a menu that evolves daily: the tasting menus provide an intimate, sharable tour of Frank's creative mind, and a la carte blink-and-you'll-miss-them masterpieces, like dry-aged duck breast with poached pear and red wine tatin tantalize the senses. Pairings aside, feel free to collaborate on an ideal bottle\u2013there's no better way to get to know someone than by their taste in wine (or so they say), and there isn't a dud on the wine list. Insider tip: Arrive early for a belt at the innovative Bank Bar, home to one of Napa Valley's best-kept secrets as far as cocktail programs are concerned. The Comeback Kid Image Source: Yelp Carpe Diem Wine Bar 1001 2nd St Napa, CA 94559 (707) 224-0800 TripAdvisor: 4.5 stars, 430 reviews Reservations: Not needed for the bar, recommended for dinner Lovingly restored following earthquake damage, Carpe Diem Wine Bar boasts a staff as enthusiastic as their regular clientele in an atmosphere that is at once sophisticated yet casual, innovative yet approachable. Chefs Kendall and Martin work in tandem to provide a menu of bite-sized eats (opt for the rotating gourmet taco selection) that are substantial enough to reach the expectations established by the wine list: while extensive, neither intrudes within the bounds of comfort\u2013best to allow yourselves to be carried away, one bite and one sip at a time. Insider tip: The cheese selection is a big deal here: it's hard to go wrong with the burrata or Quack and Cheese. French Bistro Classics Image Source: Bistro Jeanty Bistro Jeanty 6510 Washington St Yountville, CA 94599 (707) 944-0103 TripAdvisor: 4.5 stars, 1,416 reviews Reservations: Highly recommended A French bistro seemingly plucked from the quiet side streets of Paris, it's hard to imagine a establishment that carries, as quintessentially, an I-saw-it-in-the-movies-once air as Bistro Jeanty. Cozy and elegant to a beautiful fault, the atmosphere is backed up by such standby provincial classics as Coq au Vin and Steak Frites, seasoned and cooked to understated perfection. The sum creates an effortlessly special spot\u2013that little tucked-away place where anniversaries come and go with the passing of the years. Insider tip: The tomato soup, served under a flaky pastry puff crust, is as fun to eat as it is tasty. Incredible Food to Match the Views Image Source: Yelp Auberge du Soleil Bar 180 Rutherford Hill Rd Rutherford, CA 94573 (707) 963-1211 TripAdvisor: 4.5 stars, 686 reviews Reservations: Not needed Perched atop a tranquil hillside in Napa Valley, this Michelin-starred restaurant offers panoramic views of Napa\u2014a picturesque setting for a memorable, utterly romantic meal. The same magic is touted at the restaurant's bar, with wraparound decks to a western view. Obviously, snag a seat at sunset for a breathtaking vista. Insider tip: Opt for a glass of the proprietary sparkling wine, the Auberge du Soleil Private Reserve Non-Vintage Brut. It's unique, it's refreshing. A Hidden Gem Image Source: Yelp Terra 1345 Railroad Ave St Helena, CA 94574 (707) 963-8931 TripAdvisor: 4.5 stars, 180 reviews Reservations: Required Terra is owned by partners Hiro Sone and Lissa Doumani, who have over 60 years of combined experience in the highest echelons of the culinary and pastry worlds. The restaurant turns out refreshing, unique dishes in continental style with the slightest homage to Japanese cuisine; they're matched by equally fine desserts (the black pepper panna cotta in particular is worth saving room for). Well-known in local and San Francisco culinary circles, Terra is still inexplicably flying under the radar for most visitors to Napa Valley, so now's the time to give it a whirl. Insider tip: Go \u201cTerra-lite\u201d by visiting Bar Terra instead. It's a more casual offering that still offers the best of the kitchen. Havanna Vibes Image Source: Yelp Sam's Social Club 1712 Lincoln Ave Calistoga, CA 94515 (707) 942-4913 TripAdvisor: 4 stars, 83 reviews Reservations: Not needed for the bar, recommended for dinner Sam's Social Club recently opened at the gorgeously renovated Indian Springs Resort & Spa in Calistoga. A step through the front door transports visitors into a modernist's version of 1940s Havana, with potted palms, eclectic artwork, and cane furniture filling the sunlit main room. All the while, the outdoor terrace feels miles away from the bustle of the street, evoking the romantic charm and rum-dashed mystique of old Cuba. Order a cocktail from the bar and start your evening on a fine note. Insider tip: Try the Aqua Caliente, a zingy blend of house-infused habanero vodka, passion fruit puree, and demerara sugar. Fresh ingredients, stellar wine lists, exceptional service, and panoramic views are the norm in Napa Valley, making it a memorable spot to share with someone special.

Insider tip: Be sure to ask about the monthly enchilada special, it might be an ordering game changer.

        "title": "Oakville Wineries: Tasting in 2 Days",
        "text": "Oakville is located in the middle of the Napa Valley and is home to some of the most famous wineries and best Cabernet Sauvignon in the region. We'll skip a few of the names you probably already know \u2013 Robert Mondavi, Opus One, and focus on the wineries you should know. Read on to become as knowledgeable about Oakville as a local. Day 1 Art and Wine Image Source: Yelp Turnbull Wine Cellars 8210 St Helena Highway Oakville, CA 94562 (707) 963-5839 TripAdvisor : 4.5 stars, 58 reviews Reservations: Not required for the bar tasting, required for the private tasting Directions: Drive 12 miles north from Napa on Highway 29, the winery will be directly on your right This beautiful winery was built by modernist architect William Turnbull, and an architect's eye is apparent in everything about the building, from the vaulted ceilings to the way it seems made for its space amongst the sequoia trees. Rich and concentrated, the wines are classic examples of Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon. You can enjoy a private tasting in the living room or on the vineyard terrace, but we'd recommend not missing the casual bar tasting in the Gallery Tasting Room. This is because the space is also home to a rotating collection of historic black and white photography from some of the most respected photographers in the business, including Ansel Adams and Dorothea Lange. Insider tip: Just 1.5 miles north of Turnbull is La Luna , an authentic Mexican grocery store that sells the best burritos and quesadillas in the north end of Napa Valley. Cult Experience Image Source: Yelp Ghost Block 7830-40 Saint Helena Hwy Oakville, CA 94558 (866) 422-4818 Reservations: Required Directions: Turn left out of Turnbull onto Highway 29 heading south. Drive 0.5 miles and take a left onto Oakville Cross Road. The winery is part of a larger crush facility, so ask your reservationist where to park and meet your host. The Pelissa family has been farming Cabernet Sauvignon in Oakville since 1903 and selling grapes to some of the best wineries in the Napa Valley. They started their own brand in 2006, and the results are stunning. Their Sauvignon Blanc is made in the French sur lie style (aging the wine with the dead yeast cells, or lees, after fermentation), giving the wine a full, creamy mouthfeel while retaining bracing acidity. The Cabernet Sauvignon is 100% Cabernet and 100% Oakville: steel beams of structure overlaid with plush black fruit and smooth tannins. Private tastings with family members are available by appointment. Insider tip: The always-delicious Oakville Grocery is a stones throw from the winery, so be sure to hit it up for a breakfast sandwich or tasty lunch before or after your visit. European Flair Image Source: Yelp Far Niente 1350 Acacia Dr Oakville, CA 94562 (707) 944-2861 TripAdvisor : 5 stars, 100 reviews Reservations: Required Directions: Head back out to Highway 29 on Oakville Crossroad. Take a left onto Highway 29 heading south, drive 0.2 miles and take a right onto Oakville Grade. Drive 1 mile and turn left onto Acacia Drive. Follow this road until you reach the winery. If you want to visit Switzerland while you\u00edre in Napa Valley, you're in luck. Far Niente's gorgeous European-inspired chalet on the western hillside will transport you, and then their velvety wines will bring you right back to Napa Valley. They make a classic Napa Valley Chardonnay with plenty of creamy oakiness, and the Cabernet Sauvignons are deep and well-structured. The thorough tour of the winery includes a stop at the vintage car barn and finishes with a delicious wine and food pairing. Insider tip: Be sure to taste the Dolce sweet botrytis wine paired with blue cheese. It's as close to heaven as a wine pairing will get you. Oakville Classic Image Source: TripAdvisor & Yelp Cardinale Winery 7600 St Helena Hwy Oakville, CA 94562 (800) 588-0279 TripAdvisor : 4.5 stars, 15 reviews Reservations: Required Directions: Take Acacia Drive back out to Oakville Grade, turn right onto Oakville Grade and follow it out to Highway 29. Turn right onto Highway 29, and drive south for less than a mile. Take a left at the Cardinale sign. Cardinale makes just one wine per vintage, a Cabernet Sauvignon blend from the best mountain vineyard properties around Napa Valley, including Mt. Veeder, Howell Mountain, Spring Mountain, and Diamond Mountain. The wine is rich, luscious and powerful, a true modern Napa Valley Cabernet. The winery is situated on top of one of the many hills that dot the center of Napa Valley, giving uninterrupted views of both ends of the valley, and the tasting experience is as private and elegant as you would expect. Insider tip: Make your reservation a few weeks in advance, and a few months in advance during the busy season (May \u2013 October), as appointments are limited and popular. An American Classic Image Source: Yelp Silver Oak Cellars 915 Oakville Cross Rd Oakville, CA 94562 (707) 942-7022 TripAdvisor : 4.5 stars, 205 reviews Reservations: Recommended Directions: The Oakville Cross Road bridge is closed for repairs starting in September 2015, so you'll\u00a0need to take a slightly longer route. Turn left onto Highway 29, drive south for 3 miles and take a left onto the Yountville Cross Road. Follow this to the Silverado Trail, where you'll take a left, drive 2.4 miles, and then take a left onto Oakville Cross Road. Drive 1.8 miles and the winery is on your left. Silver Oak is renowned for their Cabernet Sauvignon's unique flavor profile, which is gained from their signature move\u2014aging the wines in American oak barrels. This gives the wines vanilla and coconut flavors, as well as a soft roundness. The winery's classic wine country architecture simultaneously makes you feel relaxed and refined, and they have several wine tasting experiences on offer, from a casual current vintage tasting to a private tour of the estate. Insider tip: Be sure to snap a picture with the famous white water tower outside the winery, whose image iconically graces the Silver Oak wine label. Day 2 Major Fun at Miner Image Source: Yelp Miner Family Winery 7850 Silverado Trail Oakville, CA 94562 (800) 366-9463 TripAdvisor : 4 stars, 71 reviews Reservation: Not required for the bar tasting, required for tours and classes Directions: Head north from Napa on the Silverado Trail for 11 miles, the winery will be on your right. Right off the Silverado Trail with a spectacular view across the Napa Valley, Miner Family Wines is a great place to casually stop in (no appointments required at the bar). They specialize in Cabernet Sauvignon blends, but make other interesting wines too, including Sangiovese, Tempranillo, and Rh\u00f4ne Valley blends. Tasting experiences include the causal bar tasting, a cave tour and a sommelier-led tour and tasting, take your pick. Insider tip: Book the Oracle Blending Seminar, where you'll\u00a0try your hand at blending the five traditional Bordeaux varietals into your own unique blend, and then taste it against the Miner Family Oracle red wine blend. Rock &\u00a0Roll Cabernet Image Source: Yelp Gargiulo Vineyards 575 Oakville Cross Rd Oakville, CA 94558 (707) 944-2770 Reservations: Required Directions: Turn left onto Silverado Trail, drive south for 2 miles and take a right onto Oakville Cross Road. In 0.2 miles the winery is on your left. The Gargiulo family comes from a farming background and has been farming in Oakville since the 1980s, so they know a thing or two about growing Cabernet Sauvignon. Their inky, dense Oakville wines will give you a whole new appreciation for the intensity of Cabernet Sauvignon. Private tours and tastings are available at the winery by appointment, where you'll tour the vineyards and then be guided through a tasting of the wines in their beautiful tasting room made of reclaimed materials. Insider tip: Be sure to check out Jeff Gargiulo's prized guitar collection, and he may even let you play one! Fun with Shakespeare Image Source: Yelp & PlumpJack Winery PlumpJack Winery 620 Oakville Cross Rd Oakville, CA 94562 (707) 945-1220 TripAdvisor : 3.5 stars, 42 reviews Reservation: Not required for groups of less than 7 Directions: Turn left back onto Oakville Cross Road, drive a few hundred feet and turn into the winery on your right. Named for the lovable rascal in Shakespeare, this playful winery specializes in Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. Interestingly, most of the wines, even the Reserve wines, are bottled with screw caps, as a continuation of the winery's commitment to approachability and sustainability. The tasting room is fun and laid back, with a refreshingly irreverent atmosphere; you'll probably end up laughing over glasses of Cabernet with new friends before your visit is over. Insider tip: This winery is very dog friendly, so bring the pooch and relax on the patio! Family-Focused Farming Image Source: Groth & Yelp Groth Vineyards & Winery 750 Oakville Cross Rd Oakville, CA 94562 (707) 754-4254 TripAdvisor : 4.5 stars, 18 reviews Reservations: Required (closed Sundays) Directions: Turn right onto Oakville Cross Road, drive 0.5 miles and the winery is on your right. The Groth family purchased vineyard land in Oakville in 1981, and was soon farming full-time to produce the lush, fruit-filled wines they make today. They specialize in Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon, but their Sauvignon Blanc is also worth checking out (and quite a bargain at $20). Tastings and tours are offered on certain days at certain times, so check their website. The brightly painted adobe-style winery is hard to miss as you drive down Oakville Cross Road. Insider tip: The special Rooted in Oakville Tour includes an in-depth tour of the winery and vineyards, followed by a tasting of current vintages, barrel samples, and library wines. Certainly the best way to get to know Groth! An Oakville Surprise Image Source: brick & mortar and Back Room Wines brick & mortar Oakville, CA 94562 Reservations: Required (closed Saturday through Monday) Directions: The winery will provide address and directions when you book your appointment We'll\u00a0throw a curveball at you with brick & mortar: Not only is it one of the newest wineries in Oakville\u2014founded in 2011\u2014but it specializes in Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. The fruit is sourced from Napa Valley Atlas Peak (from Italian legend Antinori vineyard, in fact) and Spring Mountain, as well as Sonoma Russian River Valley, and made into bold, beautiful wines. They are open for private tastings by appointment at their winery, which includes a tour of the vineyards and cellar. Insider tip: Ask for a taste of the Rose of Pinot Noir, then buy a few bottles to take home; it's\u00a0a delightfully refreshing, pear and strawberry-filled wine, and a bargain at $22. It's\u00a0hard to go wrong in the heart of Napa Valley, but these ten Oakville wineries will give you a great start in one of the best Cabernet Sauvignon regions in the world.

Drive 7 miles up the winding mountain road, and right after you've passed the peak, as you begin to descend into Sonoma Valley, you'll see a sign for Pride Mountain on the right. Perched at the top of the mountain with one foot in Napa County and one in Sonoma County (check out the line dividing the crush pad into two counties), Pride Mountain is a must-see. Tasty wines are made from both sides of the mountain, and their Cabernet Franc is one of the best to be found. Insider tip: Be sure to take the barrel tour for an inside look into the operation (and maybe some barrel samples!).

The wines benefit from the steep hills around the winery, as the challenging conditions and good soil drainage produce grapes that are full of flavor.

Their farmer beginning carries through to today, where the terroir of Spring Mountain shines through the excellent wines. The sleek wooden tasting room overlooks rows of vines that undulate down to the valley floor, giving you one of the best views on the mountain. Insider tip: Ask to be seated on the balcony overlooking the sloping vineyards. It doesn't get much more Wine Country than this.

Insider tip: Give their Mernet a try, a unique blend of half Merlot and half Cabernet (Sauvignon or Franc), with different vineyards providing the fruit each year.

        "text": "Newton Vineyard stands out in Napa Valley as one of the premier wineries of the region. They were one of the first to establish themselves on Spring Mountain, which is west of St. Helena. Their style of winemaking could be described as meticulous; the grapes are hand-picked in small batches and each part of a blend ferments separately, giving them plenty of options when it comes to what they want to combine. Their location offers splendid views of the Valley, and makes for perfect ambience when it comes to a wine tasting tour. In this Q&A, you'll find out everything you'd want to know about Newton Vineyard and their winemaking practices, as well as why their Vineyard is one of the most exciting to visit in the region. Tell us a bit about the history of Newton Vineyard\u2026 Newton Vineyard was one of the first wineries on Spring Mountain, a rugged yet serene appellation located west of St. Helena on the eastern flank of the Mayacamas range. Newton Vineyard was established by Dr. Su Hua and Peter Newton, whose trailblazing vision transformed the hillside into a 540-acre estate with 120 acres of planted vines. What distinguishes your winery from others in the region? We are proud to have one of the most distinctive properties in Napa Valley. The winery sits high above Napa Valley, affording a beautiful view. We are famous for our gardens including a parterre garden sits above our caves and a rose garden located next to the vineyards. We are close to St. Helena, but you feel a world away. Is there a wine, currently at your winery, that your guests are raving about? What makes it special? The 2012 vintage of our flagship wine, The Puzzle, was released earlier this year and this vintage is made from exclusively Cabernet Sauvignon. It includes fruit from three estate vineyards in Napa Valley: Spring Mountain, Mt. Veeder and Yountville. The Spring Mountain fruit expresses an intensity and opulence that is balanced by an unparalleled vibrancy. Mt. Veeder produces fruit with a fine structure and classic Cabernet aromas and flavors, such as red and black fruit and tobacco. And Yountville offers fruit with a plushness, middle palate and deep, dark fruit flavors and aromas, such as cassis and ripe plums. Guests love it. What do you hope guests take away after visiting your winery? We hope guests will feel rewarded for going off the beaten path and having discovered Newton will recognize it for the gem that it is. We hope they'll feel pampered and will have long-lasting memories. What's a unique characteristic of your winery that guests might not immediately notice? Everywhere you look there is first a view and then a view within a view. Peter Newton was very careful to capitalize on nature's beauty and it is important to us to protect those elements. How do you hope to see your winery evolve in the next 10 years? We are systematically replanting the estate's vineyards so our winemaking team will continue to have the best fruit sources possible. Are there any exclusive experiences that your winery offers that guests should know about? A guest's favorite experience is only available in summer and involves a ride through the vineyard in a repurposed six-wheel Pinzgauer. You climb to Pino Solo, our iconic tree at the top of our property and are rewarded with a panoramic view of Napa Valley. What are your top five wine tastings tips for first time visitors to your winery? Bring your camera. The property and view are spectacular so you will want to capture it. Bring a pair of binoculars if you join our vineyard tour. The perspective from the top of our estate is unparalleled. The tour and tastings takes you through gardens, into caves and around winery equipment so wear comfortable shoes. The varied terrain is worth foregoing heels! Leave a little extra time. Newton is off the beaten path and, if you arrive early, you'll have more time to take pictures and enjoy the view. Hire a local driver; they will know the directions to Newton and you will be able to relax. Author WineCountry Staff LOVE THIS CONTENT?

        "title": "Ask a Winemaker: Muiris Griffin of Round Pond Estate",
        "text": "With around 400 wineries in Napa Valley, it can be difficult for winemakers to stand out. Muiris Griffin has more than overcome that challenge with his work at Round Pond Estate . In addition to utilizing new techniques to get the absolute best yield from their soil, Muiris has developed innovative winemaking techniques that allow for the production of single-berry wines\u2014a longtime goal for many winemakers\u2014which has the potential to significantly impact in the wine industry. In this interview, Muiris provides an insider perspective on what it takes to run one of the leading wineries in Napa Valley. In addition to discussing micro sites and the production of his single-berry wine, he explains to us why visitors to his winery are so important to his long-term success, along with some of the steps he and his staff take to ensure that everyone has a memorable and fun time while visiting Round Pond Estate. If you're interested in getting an inside look into the mind of a leading winemaker, then read on. 1. What's your favorite spot in Rutherford? My favorite spot in Rutherford is without a doubt the gravel streaks running through the Eastern section of our site. The whole Round Pond vineyard is producing amazing wines, and those streaks are consistently putting out what I think are some of the best wines in the world. 2. Aside from your own, is there a winery you are currently impressed by/enjoy? What makes it special? There are so many wineries that are putting out amazing wines up and down the Valley, and around California, it's impossible to pick out one. Obviously Thomas Rivers Brown is one of the top, and I'm always impressed by the wines he touches. And Michael Silacci at Opus One is always inspiring me to go farther in using every tool possible to get the best out of the vineyard and to optimize everything in the cellar to make absolutely incredible wines. 3. What are your top three favorite local wines? International wines? Top three local wines are definitely Montebello from Ridge, Opus One, and Smai. Top international are Chateau Pape Clement, Vieux Telegraphe, and Jean Luc Columbo. 4. If you're going out after work, where can you be found? I'll frequently stop at The Rutherford Grill after work\u2014it's kind of my hang out spot just down the road. But sitting out on our Terrace has to be one of the best places to be in the Valley! 5. What is one aspect of wine you wish people knew more about? I would say balance of structure and acidity. I think getting that tannin/acid balance right is the biggest qualitative factor in making Rutherford Cab. Also sweet fruit flavors vs. sugar, a lot of people equate a sweet fruit profile with residual sugar, like on our Rutherford Sauvignon Blanc which has tons of rich sweet fruit notes but is totally dry. 6. What is your favorite wine & food pairing? My favorite pairings right now are sparkling with sushi, or our Sauvignon Blanc with some slightly spicy curry (can't do it too spicy, I'm Irish!). 7. What winemaking trend are you most excited about? Least excited about? The thing I'm most excited about is locating micro sites within vineyard blocks to get the absolute best out of your various soil profiles. We have so many tools now to identify different soil types in the vineyard and such a better understanding of how those differences can be optimized for the best possible quality. The wines better represent the sites from which they come, and we have much better options during blending. They're aren't really any trends that I'm negative on. I think the more crazy, random things people do in the vineyard or in the winery, the more we all learn based on the results. 8. How did you come to wine as a profession? Wine as a profession was actually proposed to me after taking an aptitude test in middle school. I thought nothing of it at the time, but after studying in France after high school I had grown rather fond of wine (mostly very cheap Ros\u00e9) and I was thrilled to rediscover the wine country where I'd grown up. I started with a family friend in their tiny vineyard and I was hooked! 9. What's the best part about your job? There are so many great things about my job, least favorite is probably all the spreadsheeting, most favorite is probably the artistic expression it allows me. This is not a perfect science. I do the things I do because I believe those techniques to be the best to extract all of the potential quality from the grapes we grow here, but someone else would surely do something different. Even though I want to be as hands off as possible in the cellar, I still feel like I get to express myself through these wines. 10. Finish this sentence: \u201cWine should be\u2026\u201d Wine should be enjoyed! Every wine, every time. It should be enjoyed for what it is, regardless of what it is. If you don't like a particular wine you may be served at a dinner party for instance, don't just choke it down to move on, try to enjoy every sip for what it is in that moment. 11. What's the most exciting thing about Round Pond? We're doing a lot of exciting things both with our winemaking as well as the visitor experience. I think the way we're dividing up each block into tiny micro sites based on the specific profile of the soil is yielding awesome results! It takes a huge amount of work to farm these micro sites differently within the blocks, but it allows us to hone in practices based on the performance of each vine. Whether you come for a short olive oil or wine tasting or one of our in-depth, all day experiences, we aim to share a piece of the Napa Valley lifestyle with you. Our estate is nearly 400 acres and includes 12 acres of olive trees, six acres of organic gardens from which we source fruits, vegetables, and eggs for our pairing menus. I'm a fan of our Terrace Lounge tastings on Friday evenings in the summer (April \u2013 October at 6 \u2013 8 p.m. by appointment only). As most wineries are closing up for the day, our guests are enjoying the fantastic Napa Valley sunset and views of the iconic Mayacamas Mountains paired with wines and special bites inspired by the garden produce. It's just heaven. Excited to explore Round Pound Estate and nearby wineries? Discover Oakville-Rutherford wineries and start planning your trip today! Author WineCountry Staff LOVE THIS CONTENT?

        "title": "Hiking in Napa Valley: Trails and Safety Tips",
        "text": "In addition to vineyards and wineries, Napa Valley is home to rolling hills and scenic vistas that are perfect for day hikes. Hiking in Napa Valley is a fun and adventurous way to spend a day in wine country\u2014the region is full of options for all levels of hikers. Before you set out on your journey, review these tips to make sure your hike is safe and enjoyable. Pick your difficulty level before you embark. Hiking can range from leisurely to strenuous, depending on the terrain you will cross. If you're unsure of how much ground you can cover, or you're unaware of the fitness level of all members of your hiking party, always opt for the less strenuous route. Easy hikes : Yountville Crossroads (1.03 mile loop) is part of the Napa River Ecological Reserve and is home to many native bird species. In addition to bird watching you'll see ash trees, blackberry bushes, and wild grapevines. Trailhead location: Between Hwy 29 and Silverado Trail in Yountville; entrance is by the bridge. Enjoy a less crowded hiking experience on one of the crisscrossing two mile loop trails at Westwood Hills Park , where you'll pass under a canopy of stunning old oak trees and just might see some cattle. Parking at Westwood Hills Park is free. Trailhead location: Thompson Avenue at Browns Valley Road in Napa; trail begins at the edge of the parking lot. Moderate hikes : Survey the oak forest and grasslands on the Sugarloaf Mountain Trail , a 7.4 mile loop that should take about a half day to complete. Shade is limited, so wear sunscreen. Trailhead location: 2201 Imola Ave. in Napa; trail begins inside the Skyline Wilderness RV park at the end of Imola Avenue. Traverse the five miles to the top of Mt. St. Helena in Robert Louis Stevenson State Park and enjoy the view of the San Francisco Bay Area or, on clear days, the top of Mt. Shasta. This hike is perfect for spring and fall, but dress appropriately for snow and chilling winds in the winter. Trailhead location: 7 miles north of Calistoga on Highway 29; trail begins at the parking lot on Highway 29. Skyline Park also features a range of moderate hikes on its 20+ miles of trails. Enjoy gorgeous views of Napa Valley along with the park's native plant garden. Entrance to Skyline Park is free and there is no admittance to the park 30 minutes before closing time. Trailhead location: 2201 Imola Ave. in Napa; trail begins inside the park at the 4th Ave./Imola Avenue East parking and picnic area. Wear a watch. Before you start walking, review the length of time it should take you to complete your hike. Always remain aware of the elapsed time and be mindful of when sunset starts. Weather conditions can change quickly after the sun goes down and many state parks close at sunset. If you do not think you will be able to complete your hike before the sun goes down, save your hike for another day. Stay on marked trails. It's temping to add a little extra adventure while hiking in Napa Valley, but straying from marked trails can lead you onto private property or jeopardize your safety. Stay on official park trails to accurately gauge your distance and reduce your risk of becoming disoriented or lost. Beware of poison oak. Poison oak can leave an itchy reminder of your day spent hiking, so it's best to avoid it completely. Wear long pants, stay on marked trails, and refrain from touching any unknown plants. If you see a red, itchy rash where your skin has been exposed to plants, wash the area with soap and water and avoid scratching or touching the area, as this can cause the rash to spread. Use hydrocortisone cream to minimize the itching or take short, lukewarm baths. If your poison oak rash does not improve after seven to ten days, see your doctor. Prepare for various types of weather. Napa's mild weather makes it a great location for year-round hiking. However, weather conditions can change quickly, especially in high elevations. Wear sunscreen (even during the winter), bring or wear a lightweight wind-blocking jacket, and bring gloves if you're going to begin your hike in the morning hours when the wind is still cool. Bring plenty of water. Basic hiking safety tips apply while hiking in Napa Valley and bringing enough water is extremely important. Two liters of water per person per day is the recommended amount while hiking. Bring more water if your hike will be strenuous or during summer months. Leave the wine at home. Alcohol consumption is prohibited in all State Parks, so you will have to enjoy your favorite Napa wines during a winery tour/tasting or back at your hotel. Pack snacks. Hiking can cause you to work up an appetite so bring energy-promoting snacks like nuts, fruit and vegetables, or an assortment of local Clif Bars. Throw your wrappers in designated trash areas or pocket them to discard back in the parking lot. Invite your dog. Some Napa Valley hiking trails permit you to bring your canine companions with you while you enjoy the fresh air. Pope Canyon Trail is an easy 2.1 mile trek for humans and dogs and culminates with a beautiful view of Pope Creek. Be sure to research specific rules regarding dogs for any of the trails you wish to hike before you set off. Image source: Meadowood Author WineCountry Staff LOVE THIS CONTENT?

        "title": "How to Choose a Wedding Photographer",
        "text": "Ensure your special day in Napa/ Sonoma is captured on film. Weddings in Wine Country are generally chosen for their scenic appeal, which makes finding the right photographer all the more important. Napa is a popular location for destination weddings, but long distance research can put a strain on your wedding planning enthusiasm. Here are some tips to help you choose the right Wine Country wedding photographer for your big day: Research Browse local listings, read reviews, and immerse yourself in bridal forums in an effort to begin weeding out the photographers that stand out from those that strike out. Then visit their personal websites and social media pages to pursue portfolios of weddings held in similar venues. Keep a keen eye out for customer reviews, testimonials, and how responsive they are to your communications. Meet in person Online research is all well and good, but few things can substitute for an in-person interview to discuss your expectations and desires on your wedding day. If you like what you see in the portfolios and are comfortable with their service fees, set up a personal interview during your next trip out to wine country. In fact, if you're traveling to the Napa/ Sonoma area, schedule interviews with up to 5 available photographers so that you can compare notes. WineCountry Tip: Read what the say about themselves, that can give you an insight to their personality. Tim Halberg (picture below) considers himself; Adventurous, Mischievous and Indulgent \u2013 which definitely comes shows through his lens. Think about style Every wedding photographer has a particular aesthetic and point of view. Paging through endless photo galleries will help you hone in on the style that most speaks to you. A photojournalist/ documentary style will focus on telling the candid story of your wedding, portraiture will emphasize posed moments, and fine art photographers will produce highly dramatic, slightly grainy images often shot on film rather than digital. Napa favorite T.J. Salsman is one local photographer that specializes in a photojournalistic approach. Once you've identified your style preference, narrow down the list of photographers to include only those who have a similar perspective. Ask the right questions Ensure that you are meeting with the photographer who would be covering your wedding, not a sales consultant or studio owner. During the interviews you'll want to get a sense of their experience, professionalism, aesthetic, and personality. Come prepared with some of your top questions or concerns written down so you can be sure to get as much value out of your time together as possible. Ask to see full galleries of past weddings \u2013 not just the hand-picked galleries available online. This will give you an idea of what your full collection of photos may look like. Ask when you will receive the edited proofs and how many images you should expect. Inquire about whether digital files are available and what additional products are for sale. During the interview process, pay particular attention to the photographer's personality and demeanor. Having a photographer that is responsive to your needs and requests is perhaps the most important aspect. You want someone who proactively makes suggestions but is friendly enough to accommodate any special requests you may have. Review the contract Before booking your wedding photographer, carefully examine the services contract to ensure that there aren't any surprises on your big day. The contract should stipulate exactly who will be shooting your wedding, the contingency plan should that person become unavailable, whether any assistants will be attending, who owns the rights to the images, the final rate, and how many hours of photography coverage are included. If anything is not up to your expectations, feel free to ask and re-negotiate, professional photographers are often open to accommodating special requests. Author WineCountry Staff LOVE THIS CONTENT?

Certainly Napa can accommodate 5-star tastes, but it can also be refreshingly budget-friendly; it's just a matter of knowing where to look and pulling together all the right pieces. Here are our favorite elements of a girl's getaway in Napa: Cozy Accommodations: Milliken Creek Inn California wine country hotels and boutique accommodations are beloved for their warmth, luxury, and personalized touches. Reserve rooms at the Milliken Creek Inn, located in downtown Napa, and enjoy a wine and cheese social hour on the terrace, breakfast in bed, and an on-site spa, all tucked into a picturesque setting that makes for a charming hideaway. Shopping: In the past couple decades, downtown Napa has flourished and today includes a wealth of stores that can satisfy everyone from the souvenir shoppers to the stylish fashionistas on the lookout for a one-of-a-kind boutique. Take a peek inside the Helen Lyall clothing boutique at Riverfront or visit the Cake Plate Boutique for a tantalizing selection of women's clothing and accessories. Winery Tours: Mumm Napa Certainly no trip to Napa is complete without ample time to meander through the wineries that dot the countryside just outside of the city. If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, gather the ladies for a sparkling wine tasting Mumm Winery and enjoy a leisurely afternoon on the winery's outdoor patio. Chances are that after a flight of three bubblies, the tiny bubbles will spark some unforgettable conversation. Night Caps: Solbar at Solage Napa Valley night life is generally rather calm, but there are still many venues that stay open into the wee small hours. Keep the girl talk going and saunter up to one of the city's numerous wine bars, or cocktail lounges, including Solbar at Solage Calistoga. Enjoy the ambiance and ample wine list alongside the company of dear friends. The Bottom Line: Napa offers all the ingredients for a girl's getaway weekend that will not soon be forgotten!
